24) Give some useful tips on JIRA Workflow

As such Statuses are global objects in JIRA. Changing the name of the status on one workflow will change the status on all workflows that use that status
Hover over status or transition to see the relevant transition labels
One cannot clone transitions in the workflow designer
In the workflow designer, one cannot create annotations
Directly you cannot set the issue editable property.
25) What are the limitations when editing an active workflow?

If a workflow is active, you cannot edit the workflow name (only the description)
You cannot delete the workflow steps
A step associated status cannot be edited
You cannot add any new outgoing transition if a step has no outgoing transitions (Global transitions are not considered).
A step's Step ID cannot be changed.
26) In JIRA workflow, is it possible to transition an issue back to its previous status?

Practically, it is not possible to transition an issue back to its previous status.  However, you can use the "on hold" feature to transition an 
issue back to its prior status. Here are the steps,

In a workflow, Create a global transition to the 'On Hold' state.
Now from 'On Hold' status create another transition to every other status you want to come back to
Since the transition names cannot be the same, add a blank space at the end of it.
Now you don't want the status transition from the 'On Hold' and 'Done' to 'On Hold' So you will hide the other status "On Hold" by adding the 
value field condition on the global transition.
27) What is the role of Validators in JIRA?

The Validators in JIRA checks that any input made to the transition is valid before the transition is performed.  If a validator fails, the 
issue will not progress to the destination status of the transition.

28) What types of Post functions are carried out after the transition is executed?

Types of Post functions carried out after transition is executed includes

Adding a comment to an issue
Generating change history for an issue
Updating an issue's fields
Generating an event to trigger email notifications
29) What is an event in JIRA?

The events are classified in two a System event (JIRA defined events) and Custom event (User-defined events). An event describes the status, 
the default template and the notification scheme and workflow transition post function associations for the event.

30) What is the Audit Log?

Under Audit Log, you can see all the details about the issue created, and the changes made in the issues.

31) For an Agile project, how user stories in JIRA are created?

For an Agile project to create user stories in JIRA, follow below steps.

Issue type -Epic and Issue type - Story linked to it. In order to do so, in the 'Create Issue' page, go to "Configure Fields" and select 
"Epic link" field to be included in the issue creation screen.
Or you can have a product backlog by creating a main User story and having various sub-tasks under it.
32) What is an "issue collector"?

An "issue collector" enables you to easily embed a JIRA feedback form into your own web site. This helps website visitors to log issues into 
JIRA through our website.  To use JIRA feedback form, visitors to our website do not need a user account in JIRA.

33)  State the difference between Bugzilla and JIRA?

<table class="table table-striped" width="50%"> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Bugzilla</strong></td> <td><strong>JIRA</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><ul> <li>It is an Open Source</li> </ul> </td> <td><ul> <li>It is a commercial tool</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><ul> <li>Using Bugzilla might be little complicated for few due to grouping users and granting permissions</li> </ul> </td> <td><ul> <li>For some using JIRA would be more convenient than Bugzilla</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><ul> <li>Bugzilla allows you to show/hide the whole custom field or specific values based on the value of some other field</li> </ul> </td> <td><ul> <li>JIRA enables conditional configuration based only on Type fields and Project.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><ul> <li>Bugzilla's has a powerful advanced search option</li> </ul> </td> <td><ul> <li>JIRA lacks advance-level search options. JIRA has a flexible JQL language (JIRA Query Language). It enables you to build arbitrary boolean expressions.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><ul> <li>Unlike JIRA, Bugzilla allows users to select the initial status of a new issue.</li> </ul> </td> <td><ul> <li>Unlike Bugzilla, JIRA enables you to define multiple workflows which are applied based on the issue's Project and Type.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><ul> <li>Bugzilla has only one link type: Blocks/depends and a Bug ID custom field</li> </ul> </td> <td><ul> <li>JIRA has configurable link types with user-defined semantics. JIRA enables to link an issue to any other entity outside JIRA.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>
