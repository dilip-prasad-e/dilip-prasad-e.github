1) Explain what is the difference between Web testing and WAP testing?

WAP Testing: It is the testing the WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) used in network applications
Web Testing: It is related mainly to the testing of web applications such as websites and portals
2) List out some of the automated mobile testing tools?

For mobile testing, two kinds of automation tools are available to test mobile Applications.

Object based mobile testing tools: Jama solution, Ranorex,
Image based mobile testing tools: RoutinBot, Egg Plant, Sikuli
3) Explain what is the difference between simulator and emulator?

Simulator: It is an electronic network simulation equipment or a base station equipment for CDMA/CMA mobile phones. It helps in 
latching home networks without roaming services and can make Voice; Data calls, SMS,
Emulator: It is a software to test mobile application without a live handset
4) List out the types of mobile app testing?

The types of mobile app testing includes

Usability Testing
Compatibility Testing
Interface testing
Services testing
Low-level resource testing
Performance Testing
Operational testing
Installation tests
Security Testing
5) Mention what is the Android testing strategy?

The standard Android testing strategy must include the following test

Unit Test
Integration Test
Operation Test
System Test
6) Explain Android testing framework?

Android testing framework includes three segments

Application Package: It is the target application that requires to be tested
Instrumentation TestRunner: It is a Test Case runner that runs test cases on target application. It includes an SDK tools for building 
test and a tool that provides APIs for writing program that control an android device, for example, MonkeyRunner
Test Package: It includes two classes, Test case classes, and Mock objects. Test case classes include test methods to perform on target 
application, while mock object includes mock data that will be used as sample input for test cases.
7) List out the best practices for Android Testing?

Developer should prepare the test cases at the same time when they are writing the code
Together with source code all test cases should be stored
Use continuous integration and execute tests every time the code is changed
Avoid using rooted devices and emulators
8) Mention what are the common bugs found while mobile testing?

Critical: Your phone system crash when testing particular feature in your device
Block: Unable to do anything though phone is on unless you reboot your device
Major: Unable to perform a function of a particular feature
Minor: Under minor bugs usually GUI bugs fall.
9) Explain what is Robo-electric testing framework?

Testing done on Android Testing Framework for emulators or device is difficult.  Running and building test case sometimes takes lots of 
development effort.  Robo-electric framework allows you to run Android test directly on JVM without the need of a device or an emulator.

10) Explain how A/B testing is done for ios app?

A/B testing for ios includes three steps

Configure a test: It prepares two versions of your iOS app (A&B) and test metric
Test: Tests two iOS versions above on devices simultaneously
Analyze: It select and measure better version to release
11) While performing end to end mobile testing what are the major criteria, you have to take in consideration?

Installation
Application launching without having network
Uninstallation of app
Orientation of app if it supports
Testing application performance on a different kind of devices and network scenarios
Testing the application response how it is responding
12) List out the features does monkey tool provides?

Monkey tools provide features like

Basic configuration options
Operational constraints
Event types and frequencies
Debugging options
13) Mention what should be the selecting criteria for Test Automation Tool for mobile Testing?

For mobile testing, the test automation tool should have following criteria

Multi-platform support: Ensure that the tool does support your current and future target platform
Script Usability: Object-based tools provides a high degree of the script usability
Jailbreak Requirement: If the tool uses rooted devices, it may not support latest OS version and may be incompatible with MDM policies
Source Code Changes: Sharing source code may not be possible always
Lead time for New OS version: How soon tool can support new iOS/android/other OS version
14) When to choose automation testing and when manual testing?

Manual Testing

If the application has new functionality
If the application requires testing once or twice
Automate Testing

If the regression tests are repeated
Testing app for complex scenarios
15) List out the most common problem that tester faces while doing mobile testing in Cloud Computing?

Challenges that tester faces while doing mobile testing are

Subscription model
High Costing
Lock-in
Internet connectivity issues
Automation is image based and time-consuming
Automation cannot be used outside the framework
16) Explain what does mobile security testing includes?

Mobile security testing includes

Checks for multi-user support without interfering with the data between them
Checks for access to files stored in the app by any unintended users
Decryption or Encryption method used for sensitive data communication
Detect sensitive areas in tested application so that they do not receive any malicious content
17) List out mobile App testing?

Testing in all web browsers
Browsers very significantly across the devices
May support xHTML,HTML,WML,AJAX
Difficulty in Benchmarking the performance due to highly fragmented Market
Emulators do not capture all the attributes or characteristics of a device
Implementation of the specification may not be consistent across vendors and devices
In some situation, transcoder may not respect user experience factors
18) Explain what is port testing?

This testing is done to test the same functionality on different devices with different platforms. It is classified into two categories

Device Testing
Platform Testing
19) List out some iPhone and iPad testing tools?

iPhone tester: Test your web interface in an i-phone sized frame
Appium: It is a test automation tool used with native and hybrid ios application
iPad Peek: Test your web application using an iPad interface
Test Studio: It enables you to record, build and run automated tests for your iPad and iPhone applications.
20) Explain how you can install SD card in emulator?

To install SD card in emulator, you have to use the command

MKsdcrd -I mySDCard 1024M mySdCardFile.img
