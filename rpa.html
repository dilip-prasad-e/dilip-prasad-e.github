UiPath is a Windows desktop software used for automation for various types of web and desktop-based applications.

8. What are the steps you should follow to implement Robotic Process Automation?

Six steps to be followed for a successful RPA implementation are:

Identify the Automation Opportunities
Optimize the Identified Processes
Build a Business Case
Select the RPA Vendor of your choice
Model RPA Development
Start Continue Building Expertise RPA bots
9. Can you audit the RPA process? What are the benefits of same?

Yes, it is possible to audit the RPA process. Auditing brings several new strategies that can easily be adopted.

10. State the different between between Thin Client & Thick Client?

<table class="table table-striped"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Thick Client</strong> </td><td><strong>Thin Client</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>The thick client is the application that requires certain attribute features using RPA tools, e.g., computer, calculator, Internet Explorer.<strong> </strong> </td><td>The thin client is the application that never acquires the specific properties while using RPA tools. </td></tr></tbody></table>

11. How long does a robot automation project take?

Generally, any projects are measured in weeks. However, the complex project might take more time depending on the 
level of object re-use available.

12. Does Blue Prism need Coding?

No, the Blue prism is a code-free and can automate and software. This digital workforce should be applied to automate 
the process in any department where clerical or administrative work is performed across an organization.

13. What is the main difference between Blue Prism And UiPath?

Blue Prism uses C# for coding and UiPath uses Visual Basic for coding.

14. What is the future scope of RPA?

The future of Robotic Process Automation is very bright as there are plenty of human actions that can be automated, 
handling RPA tools and technology.

15. Does handling RPA operations need special skills?

RPA is an approach that doesn't require programming skills. Anyone can become an RPA certified professional with some 
basic knowledge or training, which is also a short duration. Everything can be managed easily using the flowchart or 
in a stepwise manner.

16. Name two scripting standards which you will consider during automation testing?

Two scripting stands that you need to consider during automation testing are

Adequate indentation
Uniform naming convention
17. What are the key metrics which you should consider to map the success of automation testing?

Two key metrics to measure the success of automation testing are:

Reduction in cost of various modules
Defect Detection Ratio
18. Explain the use of PGP

PGP allows you to encrypt and decrypt a file by assigning a passphrase.

19. What is meant by Bot?

A bot is a set of the command used to automate the task.

20. Name different types of bots

Different types of Bots used in RPA process are:

TaskBot
MetaBot
IQ Bot
Chatbot
21. Explain the term dynamic selectors

If the selector information changes frequently, then it is called dynamic selectors

22. What is the primary goal of the RPA process?

The main object behind the development of the RPA process helps you to replace the repetitive and tedious tasks 
performed by humans, with the help of a virtual workforce.

23. How to create RPA Bot?

To create RPA bot, you need to follow these steps:

Record a task
Completed the bot implementation
Test the bot
Upload the bot the perform the automation.
24. How can you do screen scraping in RPA?

Screen scraping is an important component of RPA toolkit. It allows you to capture bitmap data from the screen 
and crosses verified it with stored details in your computer.

25. What are the benefits of screen scraping?

Here, are some major benefits of screen scraping:

Works on the application which are not accessible even using UI frameworks
Offers test digitization through Optical character
Easy to implement & mostly accurate
26. Name the framework used in software automation testing

Four most crucial framework used in software automation are:

Hybrid automation framework
Keyword-driven framework
Modular automation framework
Data-driven framework
27. What the difference between TaskBot and IQBot

Taskbot manages repetitive and rule-based tasks, while IQBot helps you to manage fuzzy rules.

28. Give an example of TaskBot

HR administration and Payment procedure are examples of TaskBot.

29. Explain the term workflow Designer

It is a graphical representation way of coding, where condition decision-based task is added for whole process requirement.

30. What is the default time out limit in timeout property?

The default timeout limit is 3000 milliseconds.

31. What the major difference between RPA and Macros?

<table class="table table-striped"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><strong>Robots</strong> </td><td><strong>Macros</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>Allows you to learn and enhance itself from the repetitive process. </td><td>Never learn anything for the repetitive process. </td></tr><tr><td>It can act Autonomously. </td><td>It cannot work autonomously. </td></tr><tr><td>It responds to external stimuli and reprograms itself. </td><td>It doesn't respond to external stimuli. </td></tr><tr><td>It offers Highly secured automation. </td><td>Security is not a high priority. </td></tr></tbody></table>
