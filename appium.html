1) Explain what is Appium?

Appium is a freely distributed open source mobile application UI Testing framework.

2) List out the Appium abilities?

Appium abilities are

Test Web
Provides cross-platform for Native and Hybrid mobile automation
Support JSON wire protocol
It does not require recompilation of App
Support automation test on physical device as well as similar or emulator both
It has no dependency on mobile device
3) List out the pre-requisite to use APPIUM?

Pre-requisite to use APPIUM is

ANDROID SDK
JDK
TestNG
Eclipse
Selenium Server JAR
Webdriver Language Binding Library
APPIUM for Windows
APK App Info On Google Play
js
4) List out the limitations of using Appium?

Appium does not support testing of Android Version lower than 4.2
Limited support for hybrid app testing. E.g., not possible to test the switching action of application from the web app to 
native and vice-versa
No support to run Appium Inspector on Microsoft Windows
5) Explain how to find DOM element or xPath in a mobile application?

To find the DOM element use "UIAutomateviewer" to find DOM element for Android application.

6) Explain the design concept of Appium?

Appium is an "HTTP Server" written using Node.js platform and drives iOS and Android session using Webdriver JSON wire protocol. 
Hence, before initializing the Appium Server, Node.js must be pre-installed on the system
When Appium is downloaded and installed, then a server is setup on our machine that exposes a REST API
It receives connection and command request from the client and execute that command on mobile devices (Android / iOS)
It responds back with HTTP responses. Again, to execute this request, it uses the mobile test automation frameworks to drive 
the user interface of the apps. Framework like
Apple Instruments for iOS (Instruments are available only in Xcode 3.0 or later with OS X v10.5 and later)
Google UIAutomator for Android API level 16 or higher
Selendroid for Android API level 15 or less
7) What language does Appium support?

Appium support any language that support HTTP request like Java, JavaScript with Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, etc.

8) Explain the pros and cons of Appium?

Pros:

For programmer irrespective of the platform, he is automating ( Android or iOS) all the complexities will remain under single Appium server
It opens the door to cross-platform mobile testing which means the same test would work on multiple platforms
Appium does not require extra components in your App to make it automation friendly
It can automate Hybrid, Web and Native mobile applications
Cons:

Running scripts on multiple iOS simulators at the same time is possible with Appium
It uses UIAutomator for Android Automation which supports only Android SDK platform, API 16 or higher and to support the older API's 
they have used another open source library called Selendroid
9) Explain what is APPIUM INSPECTOR?

Similar to Selenium IDE record and Playback tool, Appium has an "Inspector" to record and playback. It records and plays native 
application behavior by inspecting DOM and generates the test scripts in any desired language. However, Appium Inspector does not 
support Windows and use UIAutomator viewer in its option.

10) Mention what are the basic requirement for writing Appium tests?

For writing Appium tests you require,

Driver Client: Appium drives mobile applications as though it were a user. Using a client library you write your Appium tests which 
wrap your test steps and sends to the Appium server over HTTP.
Appium Session: You have to first initialize a session, as such Appium test takes place in the session. Once the Automation is done 
for one session, it can be ended and wait for another session
Desired Capabilities: To initialize an Appium session you need to define certain parameters known as "desired capabilities" like 
PlatformName, PlatformVersion, Device Name and so on. It specifies the kind of automation one requires from the Appium server.
Driver Commands: You can write your test steps using a large and expressive vocabulary of commands.
11) Mention what are the possible errors one might encounter using Appium?

The possible errors one might face in Appium includes

Error 1: The following desired capabilities are needed but not provided: Device Name, platformName
Error 2: Could not find adb. Please set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable with the Android SDK root directory path
Error 3: openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: A new session could not be created
Error 4: How to find DOM element or XPath in a mobile application?
12) Do you need a server machine to run tests on Appium?

No, you don't need server machine to run tests on Appium. Appium facilitates a 2-tier architecture where a test machine connects to a 
test server running Appium and automating the whole thing. You can have Appium running on the same machine where your test runs.

13) Is it possible to interact with my apps using Javascript while I am testing with Appium?

Yes, it is possible to interact with App while using Javascript. When the commands run on Appium, the server will send the script to 
your app wrapped into an anonymous function to be executed.

14) Mention what are the most difficult scenarios to test with Appium?

The most difficult scenario to test with Appium is data exchange.

15) While using Appium can I run my tests in a multithreaded environment?

Yes, you can run the test in a multithreaded environment but you have to ensure that no more than one test runs at the same time 
against the same Appium server.

16) In Android, do you need an app's .apk to automate using Appium or you also need app in my workspace?

In Android, you only need .apk file to automate using Appium.

17) Explain what is Appium package master? How to create package?

Appium package master is a set of tools manage and create appium packages. For example to create package you can use the code

# using es7/babe1

Gulp create-package -n <package-name>

#regular es5

Gulp create-package ---nobabe1 -n <package-name>

The package will be generated in the out/<package-name>

18) Explain how test frameworks are supported by Appium?

Appium does not support test framework as such there is no need to support them. Appium can be used with any frameworks you want.
