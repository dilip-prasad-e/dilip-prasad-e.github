<h3>30. How are Query Params different from Path Variables?</h3>
<p>Query parameters are used to sort or filter the resources, and Path Variables gets used to identify specific resources.</p>
<h3>31. What is Basic Auth in Postman?</h3>
<p>Basic Auth is a method of authorization offered by Postman for HTTP user agents, such as web browsers, to enter login and password. It becomes connected with the request after the username and password are entered.</p>
<h3>32. What is digest auth in Postman?</h3>
<p>One of Postman's authorization techniques is digest auth or digest authorization. Through this method, clients can send requests to the API first and then receive responses from the server, such as 401 illegal responses and numbers that can only be used once as absolute values.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>33. What encoding is accepted by Postman in authorization credentials?</h3>
<p>Postman only takes authorization&nbsp;credentials encoded in Base64. Postman already has this feature, or you can use a third-party service to convert the credentials to base64.</p>
<h3>34. Can we have the same names for global variables in Postman?</h3>
<p>Global variables cannot have identical names since doing so would confuse the software because they are devoid of any environment. The terms of local variables might be the same across various environments.</p>
<h3>35. What do you know about the postman monitor?</h3>
<p>For running collections, the postman monitor is employed. Collections are kept running for the duration of the user-defined time. The user must get logged in to utilize Postman Monitor. Users regularly send emails to one another to share the monitor reports.</p>
<h3>36. What is a binary form in POST methods?</h3>
<p>Postman's binary form is made to send data in a format that you cannot manually type. You use these options, which cannot be manually typed, such as an image, a file, etc., because everything in a computer is transformed into binary.</p>
<h3>37. What are the limitations of Postman?</h3>
<p>The following is a list of Postman's main drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Postman cannot process 1000+ API requests.</li>
<li aria-level="1">It might be challenging to manage collections and requests for large projects.</li>
<li aria-level="1">For managing the workspace as code, Postman is not appropriate. It is because dynamic API requests would result in a lot of code duplication.</li>
</ul>
<h3>38. How can you save the responses of API to a file in Postman?</h3>
<p>There are two ways to save an API response to a file in Postman:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">First, in the response section, click the download button.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Then, press the arrow next to the send button. An option to send and download is available here. After clicking it, Postman will prompt you for the location to save the response after the request gets successfully executed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>39. What is the significance of 301 status code?</h3>
<p>When a page has been permanently redirected from one website page to another, Postman's 301 status code gets used to indicate this. The search engine is informed that the old page is out-of-date and has to index the URL of the new page.</p>
<h3>40. Define status code 201.</h3>
<p>When you successfully create a resource using a POST or PUT request, the status code 201 denotes that the resource has been created. It uses the location header to return a link to a newly built resource.</p>
<h3>41. When do we use global variables, collection variables, and local variables?</h3>
<p>Global variables are all-purpose variables perfect for prototyping and quick results. They get utilized when transferring data to other requests.</p>
<p>You can most frequently use collection variables to store constants that don't change while the Collection is being executed. They are used for constants that remain the same throughout execution and for URLs and authentication credentials when just one environment is present.</p>
<p>Local variables are only accessible for the duration of the request that set them or while using the Newman/Collection runner. They get used whenever you want to override all other variable scopes.</p>
<h3>42. How do you remove local variables?</h3>
<p>Once you run and finish the tests, the local variables are automatically eliminated.</p>
<h3>43. What is the difference between form data and x-www-form-urlencoded?</h3>
<p>The primary distinction between form data and x-www-form-urlencoded is that the URL is pre-arranged when sent via x-www-form-urlencoded.</p>
<p></p><div banner-id="64881bacf043406e6f8b4596" index="1" class="engagingGroupBanner"><div class="detail-info-banner" data-reactroot=""><div class="left-clm"><h4>Get the IIT-M Advantage!</h4><span class="discription">PCP In Full Stack Development - MERN</span><a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/full-stack-developer-course-and-certification-iitm-pravartak?source=GhPreviewCTABanner" target="_blank" class="btn">EXPLORE COURSE</a></div><div class="right-clm"><img class="blend-mode" width="16" height="9" src="https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/banners/free_resources_banners/lead_banners/Java_Developer_Career_Bootcamp.png" alt="Get the IIT-M Advantage!"></div></div></div><p></p>

<h3>45. Why is Base64 encoding primarily used in Postman?</h3>
<p>As a result of the data being transmitted in textual form and being sent in a more accessible format, like HTML form data, the Base64 authorization credentials are typically employed. Base64 is so popular because we can rely on the same 64 characters regardless of the encoding language we use.</p>
<h3>46. What is the purpose of the 304 status code?</h3>
<p>The meaning of the status code 304 is "Not Modified." It is utilized in conditional GET requests to reduce network bandwidth usage. The response's body must be empty. Dates, locations, and other information should be in the headers.</p>
<h3>47. Is it preferable to save our work on Postman Cloud?</h3>
<p>Saving your work in the Postman cloud is not recommended because business work cannot be disclosed and must be kept private. Since Postman cloud requires sign-in, security breaches could happen if it gets used. Therefore, using Postman Cloud to save work is discouraged, and team workspace is strongly recommended.</p>
<h3>48. What are the various variable scopes provided by Postman?</h3>
<p>Postman provides the following variable scopes:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Global Variables</li>
<li aria-level="1">Local Variables</li>
<li aria-level="1">Environment Variables&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Collection Variables</li>
<li aria-level="1">Data Variables</li>
</ul>
<h3>49. Is it possible to reuse the authentication token for multiple requests?</h3>
<p>You can indeed use the authentication token more than once. To do this, create a collection, add all requests with the same authentication token, and then assign the Collection with the auth token to the Collection. By choosing "Inherit auth from parent" under the Authorization tab, we may apply it to each request separately.</p>
<h3>50. How do you write test cases for basic authentication in Postman?</h3>
<p>One of the authentication methods offered by Postman, Basic Authentication, ensures we can specify the username and password along with the API calls. We can achieve this by first configuring the API's credentials by:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Going to the Authorization tab</li>
<li aria-level="1">From the drop-down option, choose Basic Auth</li>
<li aria-level="1">Enter the API's username and password in the corresponding fields</li>
</ul>
<p>You can write the test cases like this:</p>
<p>pm.test("Is the Request Authenticated?", function () {</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var jsonData = pm.response.json();</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//if authenticated then assert to true</p>
<p>pm.expect(jsonData.authenticated).to.eql(true);</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;});</p>
<p>pm.test("Is the Content-Type present?", function () {</p>
<p>pm.response.to.have.header("Content-Type");</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;});</p>
<p>pm.test("Is it a successful POST Request?", function () {</p>
<p>pm.response.to.have.status(200);</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;});</p>
<h3>51. How do you set the same headers for all requests in a Postman Collection?</h3>
<p>Pre-request scripts are supported at the collection level and for individual requests in Postman. Any script that applies to every request in the Collection may get included in the pre-request scripts. The steps are as follows:</p>
<p>To access the pre-request tab, right-click the Collection.</p>
<p>Add the script's lines of code below to add a request header for each request included in the Collection.</p>
<p>pm.request.headers.add({</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;key: 'TestHeader',</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value: 'testValue'</p>
<p>});</p>
<p>To save the script, click Update.</p>
<p>Run the request in the Collection and check the Postman console to ensure that the headers have been added.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>52. What are workspaces in Postman? What are their uses?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Postman workplaces are just areas or spaces where one or more people can collaborate on the same Collection or set of collections. It allows the collections or requests to get logically separated from one another. Postman supports two different types of workspaces: Team and Personal.</p>
<h3>53. Does Postman provide a feature to log requests and responses?</h3>
<p>The Postman software does allow users to view requests and response parameters. But after applying the pre-request scripts, it is essential to see how you sent the request. To inspect every request and response detail in such circumstances, Postman includes an additional tool called "Postman Console." By having console.log statements in the scripts, you can additionally log the information in the console.</p>
<h3>54. How will you stop the execution of upcoming requests or the execution of the collections?</h3>
<p>You can use the code below to stop processing the next request: pm.setNextRequest (null);</p>
<p></p>
<h3>55. What do you understand by the pre-request script?</h3>
<p>Pre-request scripts are those used to run Javascript code before a request is made. Pre-processing tasks, including setting variables, parameters, headers, body data, etc., are performed using it.</p>
<h3>56. How can we use Custom Javascript libraries in our scripts with an example?</h3>
<p>We may utilize the many built-in tools and libraries that Postman offers to include our pre- or post-request scripts or test cases. Consider the use of the moment.js library. It offers a variety of helpful methods for formatting data around time. Consider a POST request that must provide the generated date for the user, who anticipates the format "DD/MM/YYYY." You can use the moment library with just one line of code. To obtain the data with the proper formatting and then store it in an environment variable, we must add the following lines of code to our pre-request script:</p>
<p>var moment = require('moment');</p>
<p>pm.environment.set('createdDate',moment().format('DD/MM/YYYY'));</p>
<h3>57. If we have a global and a local variable of the same name, which one will be given the most preference in Postman?</h3>
<p>In certain circumstances, the global variable's value is overwritten to give the local variable higher precedence.</p>
<h3>58. Does Postman allow flexibility to make use of the command-line?</h3>
<p>Any Postman collection can get executed using the Newman command-line tool that Postman offers. This <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/nodejs-tutorial/what-is-nodejs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="NodeJS">NodeJS</a>-based package uses the Newman Collection Runner to execute collections and therefore needs a node environment. It supports running assertions, pre-request scripts, or other request scripts linked with the requests that are a part of the Collection, just like Postman's Collection Runner does.</p>
<h3>59. How will you generate random numbers of a given range in Postman?</h3>
<p>Assuming you want to create numbers between the ranges of 1 to N, the pre-request script can be written as follows:</p>
<p>pm.globals.set('randomNumber', Math.floor(Math.random() * N));</p>
<p>This variable can then be used in the URL as follows:{{randomNumber}}</p>
<h3>60. What do you understand about ScratchPad?</h3>
<p>Postman allows us to work without a connection to its servers by giving us access to Scratch Pad. It offers the freedom of using some of Postman's functionalities offline. The features include sending requests, creating requests, and adding requests to collections.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>61. How do you get the cURL command based on the details of the REST API obtained from Postman?</h3>

JavaScript is the programming language used in the Postman Sandbox.</p>
<h3>2. What are Postman methods?</h3>
<p>Postman methods, also known as HTTP methods or HTTP verbs, represent the actions that can be performed on a resource through an API. Some common Postman methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>GET: Retrieves information from a specified resource.</li>
<li>POST: Submits data to be processed by a specified resource.</li>
<li>PUT: Updates a specified resource with new data.</li>
<li>DELETE: Removes a specified resource.</li>
<li>PATCH: Partially updates a specified resource.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Why is the Postman tool used?</h3>
<p>The Postman tool is used for several purposes in API development and testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>API Testing: Postman allows you to send requests to APIs and analyze the responses, making it easier to test the functionality, performance, and security of APIs.</li>
<li>API Documentation: Postman provides features to document APIs, including generating documentation with request examples and descriptions.</li>
<li>Collaboration: Postman enables team collaboration by allowing you to share requests, collections, and environments with team members.</li>
<li>Automation: Postman supports the creation and execution of automated tests, making it efficient for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.</li>
<li>Mocking: Postman's mocking capabilities enable the creation of simulated API responses, helping developers and testers work independently.</li>

          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <p>Digest Authorization is one of the authorization techniques provided by Postman. In this technique, the client first sends the request to the API and get responses from the server including a number which is usable only once, a realm value and 401 unauthorized response. We will be then sent back an encrypted data array having both username and password along with the data received from the server earlier. The server uses this data to generate an encrypted data string and compares this with what was sent for authenticating the request.</p><p>We can do this by selecting the Authorization tab, then selecting “Digest Auth” from the drop-down list. Postman window presents the fields for both stages of the authentication request. The fields required for the second stage of the request are auto-filled based on the data received from the server.

            <p>Workspaces are the areas/space given by Postman for team collaboration to work on a specific or set of collections. It provides a way to logically separate requests or collections that are personal to the developer or the team so that the maintenance of requests is made easy.</p><p>There are two types of workspaces in Postman:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Personal Workspace:</strong><ul><li>These workspaces are useful when we are working simultaneously on multiple projects and we require logical separation between the requests to handle the requests better.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Team Workspace:</strong><ul>
<li>These are created for team collaboration so that more than one person can be part of testing requests.</li>
<li>We can invite new users for collaborating on our collections by sharing the email id of the users. Once the invite is accepted, the new users can start contributing to the workspace by adding or modifying the requests.</li>

          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <p>Postman does allow viewing of requests and response parameters in the software application itself. But it is important to see how the request was sent upon applying the pre-request scripts. In such cases, Postman has an additional tool called “Postman Console” which is used for viewing every request and response detail. We can also log the details in the console by using console.log statements in the scripts.</p><figure class="image image_resized" style="width:75%;"><img data-src="https://d3n0h9tb65y8q.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/001/430/original/Does_Postman_provide_a_feature_to_log_requests_and_responses.jpg?1634121164" class="lazy-elem"></figure>

          <article class="ibpage-article">
            <p>Postman provides a lot of built-in tools and libraries that we can use to add in our pre-request or post-request scripts or test cases. Let us take the example of using the moment.js library. It provides a lot of useful functions to format data around time. Consider that we have a POST request that needs to specify the created date to the user which expects the format “DD/MM/YYYY”. We can use the moment library to perform this using a single line of code. In our pre-request script, we need to add the below lines of code to get the correctly formatted data and then store that in an environment variable:</p><pre><code class="language-plaintext hljs">var moment = require('moment');
pm.environment.set('createdDate',moment().format('DD/MM/YYYY'));
</code></pre><p>There are a lot of other useful libraries like crypto.js that are useful for converting text to encrypted values which can further be used anywhere in the request body.</p>

<h3 class="h3">10) What is an HTTP request? Give an example of an HTTP request.</h3>
<p>An HTTP request is a programming request made by the client to a named host located on a server. HTTP works as a communication interface or a request-response protocol between a client and server. The main aim of the HTTP request is to access a resource on the server. To make the HTTP request, the client uses components of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which includes the information needed to access the resource.</p>
<p><strong>An example of the HTTP request:</strong></p>
<p>A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then, the server responds to the client. The response sent by the server contains the status information about the request, and it can also contain the requested content.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">11) What are the core components of an HTTP request?</h3>
<p>Following are the five core components of an HTTP request:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>HTTP methods:</strong> It is a set of request methods used to perform needed action for a given resource (GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE).</li>
<li><strong>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):</strong> It is a kind of address that describes the resource.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP Version:</strong> It specifies the version of the HTTP. For example HTTP v1.1</li>
<li><strong>Request Headers:</strong> It specifies the content type and content length of the request. For example: <strong>Content-type:</strong> application/ JSON, Content-Length: 511</li>
<li><strong>Payload:</strong> It is used to specify the Request Body that includes message content.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">12) Why does Postman accept Base64 encoding only?</h3>
<p>Postman accepts Base64 encoding only because it transmits the data into the textual form and sends it in an easier form, such as HTML form data. This is also preferred because we can rely on the same 64 characters in any encoding language we want to use.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">13) Which type of encoding does Postman accept authorization credentials and why?</h3>
<p>Postman accepts authorization credentials in Base64 encoding only. This is inbuilt in Postman, or else you can refer to a third-party website to convert the credentials in base64. The Base64 authorization credentials are generally used because they transmit the data into a textual form and send it in an easier form, such as HTML form data.
<h3 class="h3">14) What are the core components of an HTTP Response?</h3>
<p>Following are the four core components of an HTTP Response:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Status/Response Code: The server generates the status or response codes when the client makes a request. For example, 404 means Page Not Found, and 200 means Response is OK.</li>
<li>HTTP Version: It describes the HTTP version. For example: HTTP v1.1, HTTP v1.3 etc.</li>
<li>Response Header: The Response Header includes the information for the HTTP response message. For example, Content-type, Content-length, date, status, and server type.</li>
<li>Response Body: The Response Body contains the client's data requested from the server.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">15) What is the meaning of the term environment in Postman?</h3>
<p>In Postman, the term environment is a set of key-value pairs. You can create multiple environments in Postman and switch among them quickly by pressing a button. There are 2 types of environment, global and local.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">16) Can we have two global scope variables with the same name in Postman?</h3>
<p>The global variables are global, so we cannot set duplicate names for them without any environment as it creates confusion for the software. On the other hand, local variables can have the same name but in different environments.
<h3 class="h3">17) Which one is preferred in Postman, a global or local variable?</h3>
<p>In Postman, if 2 variables have the same name (one being local, the other global), then the higher priority is of the local variable. The local variable will overwrite the global variable.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">18) How can you log variable values in Postman?</h3>
<p>In Postman, we can log the variable values in the console by using the following command:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="dp-highlighter"><div class="bar"><div class="tools"><a href="#" onclick="dp.sh.Toolbar.Command('ViewSource',this);return false;"></a><a href="#" onclick="dp.sh.Toolbar.Command('PrintSource',this);return false;"></a><a href="#" onclick="dp.sh.Toolbar.Command('About',this);return false;"></a></div></div><ol start="1" class="dp-xml"><li class="alt"><span><span>console.log(pm.variables.get("variable_name"));&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></li></ol></div><textarea name="code" class="xml" style="display: none;">console.log(pm.variables.get("variable_name"));
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">19) What is the use of Postman monitor?</h3>
<p>The Postman monitor is used for running collections. Collections run till the specified time defined by the users. It requires the users to be logged in, and the users share the Monitor reports over an email on a daily or monthly basis.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">20) What do you understand by team workspace in Postman?</h3>
<p>As we know, a workspace is a collaborative environment for users to develop and test APIs. In the same way, a team workspace is a workspace that is shared by the whole team working on the same collections of requests. Usually, it is time-consuming and hard to share the collections through external drives or other sharing; the team workspace synchronizes and collaborates all the team's work in one place.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">21) What is the difference between Query Params and Path Variables?</h3>
<p>Query Params or Query Parameters are used for sorting or filtering the resources. On the other hand, Path Variables are used for identifying specific resources.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">22) What is the use of Postman Collection runners?</h3>
<p>The Postman Collection runner is used to perform Data-driven testing. It runs a group of API requests for multiple iterations with different data sets.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">23) What is Basic Auth in Postman?</h3>
<p>In Postman, Basic Auth is an authorization technique provided for HTTP user agents like web browsers to enter username and password. After entering the username and password, it gets associated with the request.</p>
<hr>
</div></div><h3 class="h3">24) Can we import local variables in Postman Monitors?</h3>
<p>Yes, we can import local variables in Postman Monitors, but it is not allowed to import global variables in Postman Monitors.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">25) What are the main limitations of Postman?</h3>
<p>Following is the list of key limitations of Postman:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Postman cannot process 1000+ API requests.</li>
<li>In the case of huge projects, it isn't easy to manage the collections and requests.</li>
<li>Postman is not suitable for managing the workspace in the form of code. This is because there would be a lot of code duplication for dynamic API requests.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">26) What is a binary form in POST methods? What is its usage?</h3>
<p>In POST methods, the binary form is designed to send data easily in a format it is impossible to enter data manually. This is mainly used when sending large files like images, CSV files, etc., in the POST request. The binary representation is one of the easiest representations used for sending complex data with the request.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">27) What is the use of Postman cloud when we are working in a company?</h3>
<p>The Postman cloud is a common repository of companies to access Postman collections. That is why we use it when we are working in a company. We can save the work instantly in the Postman cloud after logging in. It facilitates the team members to access data/collections from anywhere.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">28) What is digest auth in Postman?</h3>
<p>The digest auth or digest authorization is one of the authorization techniques provided by Postman. This technique lets the clients send the request first to the API and get responses from the server, including a number that can be used only once a real value and 401 unauthorized responses. After that, the client can send back an encrypted data array with both username and password and the data received from the server earlier. Now, the server uses this data to generate an encrypted data string and compares this with what was sent for authenticating the request.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">29) Why is it not suggested to save work in Postman cloud?</h3>
<p>It is not suggested and is not preferred to save your work in the Postman cloud as the company's work is not allowed to be leaked and remain confidential. While saving your work on Postman cloud, it may cause a security breach as it requires sign-in. That's why the Postman Cloud is not suggested for saving work, and team workspace is highly preferred.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">30) What do you understand by status code 201?</h3>
<p>The status code 201 means created when you have successfully created a resource using POST or PUT request. It returns a link to a newly created resource using the location header.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">31) What is the procedure to remove local variables?</h3>
<p>The local variables are automatically removed once you have executed and completed the tests.
<h3 class="h3">32) What is the procedure to save the responses of API to a file in Postman?</h3>
<p>In Postman, there are two ways to save the responses of an API to a file:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>First, click on the download button in the response section.</li>
<li>Second, click on the arrow next to the send button. Here, you will see an option to send and download. After clicking on it, you will get a prompt Postman asking for the location of saving the response post successful request execution.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">33) What is the meaning of the status code 304?</h3>
<p>The status code 304 means NOT MODIFIED. It is used to minimize the network bandwidth usage in conditional GET requests. The response body should be empty. Headers should have a date, and location, etc.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">34) What is the use of the 301 status code in Postman?</h3>
<p>In Postman, the 301 status code is used to specify that the page has been permanently redirected from one website page to another. It tells the search engine that the old page is outdated, and the search engine has to index the new page URL.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">35) What is the method to organize requests in Postman?</h3>
<p>We can organize requests in Postman with the Collections.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">36) What are the various variable scopes provided by Postman?</h3>
<p>Following is a list of several variable scopes provided by Postman:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Global Variables:</strong> Global variables allow data access between different collections, requests, and scripts. They are available throughout the workspace.</li>
<li><strong>Local Variables:</strong> Local variables are the temporary variables that can be accessed only within the scope of requests scripts. Depending on the requirements, these variables are either scoped to a single request or single collection. These variables are not available once the script execution is completed.</li>
<li><strong>Environment Variables:</strong> The Environment variables allow us to tailor the requests about different development environments such as local testing, stage testing, or prod testing.</li>
<li><strong>Collection Variables:</strong> The Collection variables are independent of the environment and scoped to be available for all the requests present within the collection.</li>
<li><strong>Data Variables:</strong> The Data variables come from external JSON or CSV files and define the datasets required to run the collection in Collection Runner or Newman.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">37) What is the difference between the form data and x-www-form-urlencoded?</h3>
<p>The key difference between the form data and x-www-form-urlencoded is that the URL will be prearranged when sent through x-www-form-urlencoded.
<h3 class="h3">38) In which conditions should we use global, collection, and local variables?</h3>
<p>Global variables are the general-purpose variables. They are used while passing data to other requests and are ideal for quick results and prototyping.</p>
<p>Collection variables are generally used for storing some constants that do not change during the execution of the collection. These variables are used for constants that do not change during the execution and URLs / authentication credentials if only one environment exists.</p>
<p>Local variables are the temporary variables and are only available within the request that has set them or when using Newman/Collection runner during the script execution. These variables are used whenever we have to override all other variable scopes.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">39) How can we access the history of requests in Postman?</h3>
<p>In Postman, we can access the history of requests in the History tab provided on the Postman application. When we sign into the Postman account, the history will be synced across the devices where you are logged in. After clicking on any of the requests present in the History tab, the view will open the request that we saved while working on it earlier. History also contains the collection runs that were executed as summarized versions.</p>
<p>When you click on the "View More option" on the request, you will see options to save, document, monitor, delete or mock the request. You can also select multiple requests by using Command or Control button and then clicking on the request.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">40) How can we stop executing requests or stop the collection run?</h3>
<p>We can stop executing requests or stop the collection run by using the following command:</p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="dp-highlighter"><div class="bar"><div class="tools"><a href="#" onclick="dp.sh.Toolbar.Command('ViewSource',this);return false;"></a><a href="#" onclick="dp.sh.Toolbar.Command('PrintSource',this);return false;"></a><a href="#" onclick="dp.sh.Toolbar.Command('About',this);return false;"></a></div></div><ol start="1" class="dp-xml"><li class="alt"><span><span>postman.setNextRequest(null);&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></li></ol></div><textarea name="code" class="xml" style="display: none;">postman.setNextRequest(null);
</textarea></div>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">41) Is it possible to reuse the authentication token for multiple requests?</h3>
<p>Yes, it is possible to reuse the authentication token for multiple requests. We can achieve it by creating a collection and adding all the requests having the same authentication token to that collection and then assigning the auth token to the same collection. We can apply it to the individual requests by selecting the "Inherit auth from parent" option in the Authorization tab.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">42) Where are the query parameters stored in a GET request in Postman?</h3>
<p>In the GET request, the query parameters are stored in the URL in Postman.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">43) What is executed first in a collection run?</h3>
<p>The pre-request scripts at the compilation level are executed first in a collection run.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="h3">44) How can we access a Postman variable?</h3>

<h3 class="h3">46) What are the most commonly seen status codes in Postman?</h3>
<p>Following is the list of most commonly seen status codes in Postman:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>200 (OK):</strong> Status code 200 specifies that the request was correct.</li>
<li><strong>201 (Created):</strong> Status code 201 specifies that the value wrapped with the request has been created in the database. Here, it is obvious that the request was correct.</li>
<li><strong>204 (No Content):</strong> Status code 204 specifies that the request was correct and received, but there is no content to send. It means there is no response to send to the client by the server.</li>
<li><strong>400 (Bad Request):</strong> Status code 400 specifies a bad request. A bad request means that the syntax of the request was incorrect. It appears when we have sent the wrong parameters along with the request URL or in the request's body.</li>
<li><strong>401 (Unauthorized request):</strong> Status code 401 specifies an unauthorized request. An unauthorized request is a request for which you are not authorized. This status code appears when we are not authorized to access the server or enter the wrong credentials.</li>
<li><strong>404 (Not Found):</strong> Status code 404 specifies that the server was connected, but it could not find what was requested. It simply means "request not found". This status code normally appears when we request a web page not available on the server.</li>

<li>Response status code (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found)</li>
<li>Response headers (e.g., Content-Type, Date)</li>
<li>Response body (contains the data returned by the server)</li>
</ul>
<p></p><h3><strong>43. How do you set the same headers for all requests in a Postman Collection?</strong></h3><p></p><p>To set identical headers for all requests in a Postman Collection, you can use pre-request scripts. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>Right-click on the Collection to access the pre-request tab.</p>
<p>Add the lines of code below to the pre-request scripts section to add the desired request header for all requests in the Collection:</p>
<pre>pm.request.headers.add({ key: 'TestHeader', value: 'testValue' });</pre>
<p>Click Update&nbsp;to save the script.</p>
<p>Run any request within the Collection, and you can check the Postman console to verify that the headers have been added successfully.</p>
<p></p><h3><strong>44. How can we access the history of requests in Postman?</strong></h3><p></p><p>You can access the history of requests in Postman by clicking on the History&nbsp;tab in the left panel. This allows you to view and revisit previously sent requests along with their responses.</p>
<p></p><h3><strong>45. Is it possible to reuse the authentication token for multiple requests?</strong></h3><p></p><p>Yes, Postman allows you to reuse the authentication token for multiple requests. You can extract the token from one response using Postman variables and use it in subsequent requests using variable syntax, like {{token}}.</p>
<p></p><h3><strong>46. Is it preferable to save our work on Postman Cloud?</strong></h3><p></p><p>Saving work on Postman Cloud is a matter of personal preference and depends on the level of security and privacy required. While Postman Cloud offers the convenience of cloud-based storage and collaboration, some users may prefer to keep sensitive data on local machines.</p>
<p></p><h3><strong>47. What is the use of Postman Cloud when we are working in a company?</strong></h3><p></p><p>Postman Cloud serves as a centralized platform for team collaboration, version control, and sharing resources within&nbsp;a company. It allows teams to work together efficiently, share collections, and maintain consistency across projects.</p>
<p></p><h3><strong>48. What is digest auth in Postman?</strong></h3><p></p><p>Digest auth in Postman is a type of HTTP authentication that provides more security than basic authentication. It sends a hashed value of the username and password instead of plaintext credentials.</p>
<p></p><h3><strong>49. What is the procedure to save the responses of API to a file in Postman?</strong></h3><p></p><p>In Postman, you have two options for saving API responses to a file:</p>
<p>Firstly, you can click on the download button available in the response section.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can click on the arrow located next to the send button. There, you’ll find an option to send and download.&nbsp;After selecting it, Postman will prompt you to choose the location for saving the response upon successful request execution.</p>
<p></p><h3><strong>50. What are the standard rules of an API test design?</strong></h3><p></p><p>The standard rules of an API test design include:</p>
