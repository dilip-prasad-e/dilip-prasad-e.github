under cell section. On clicking on this, the cell size will get formatted.

17) Explain pivot tables and its uses.

A pivot table is a tool that allows for quick summarization of large data. It automatically performs a sort, count, total or average of the 
data stored in the spreadsheet and displays result in another spreadsheet. It saves a lot of time. Allows to link external data sources to our Excel.

To provide a dynamic range in "Data Source" of Pivot tables, first, create a named range using offset function and base the pivot table using 
a named range created in the first step.

20) Is it possible to make Pivot table using multiple sources of data?

If the multiple sources are different worksheets, from the same workbook, then it is possible to make Pivot table using multiple sources of data.

21) Which event do you use to check whether the Pivot Table is modified or not?

To check whether the pivot table is modified or not we use "PivotTableUpdate" in worksheet containing the pivot table.

22) How can you disable automatic sorting in pivot tables?

To disable automatic sorting in pivot tables:

Go To > More Sort Options > Right Click 'Pivot tables' > Select 'sort menu' > select 'More Options' > deselect 'Sort automatically'.

23) What is Freeze Panes in MS-Excel?

Excel provides three ways to protect a workbook:

Password protection for opening a workbook

SUBSTITUTE(A2,"9","8",1) =>Guru89,Guru99

SUBSTITUTE(A2,"9","8",2) =>Guru88,Guru99

SUBSTITUTE(A2,"9","9") =>Guru99,Guru99

The REPLACE function swaps part of the text string with another set of text.

Example: For example, you select the cell, and you want to display that cell as "Greater than five," when value is true (=5 or 5) and 
"less than five" when value is false (<5). For that by using IF condition you can display result.

=IF (Logical test, value if true, value if false)

=IF (A1>5, "Greater than five, "Less than five")

Right Click 'Worksheet tab' > Choose 'Select All Sheets'. Now any formatting done will be applied to the whole workbook. To apply to a 
particular group of sheets, select only those sheets that need formatting.

32) What are left, right, fill and distributed alignments?

Left /Right alignment align the text to left and right most of the cell.

Fill as the name suggests, fill the cell with same text repetitively.

Distributed, spread the text across the width of the cell.

<table class="table table-striped"><tbody><tr><td><p>LEFT </p></td><td><p>FILL </p></td><td><p>DISTRIBUTED </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ab </p></td><td><p>abababababababab </p></td><td><p>a b </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A </p></td><td><p>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa </p></td><td><p> A </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

You will use Advanced Criteria Filter, to analyze the list or if more than two conditions should be tested.

35) What is the quick way to return to a particular area of a worksheet?

The quick way to return to a specific area of the worksheet is by using name box. You can type the cell address or range name in name 
box to return to a specific area of a worksheet.

36) Which function is used to determine the day of the week for a date?

40) What is the AND function does in Excel?

Like IF function, AND function also does the logical function. To check whether the output will be true or false the AND function will evaluate at 
least one mathematical expression located in another cell in the spreadsheet. If you want to see the output of more than one cells in a single cell, 
it is possible by using AND function.

Example: If you have two cells, A1 and A2, and the value you put in those two cells are >5 and you want result should display as 'TRUE' in cell B1 if 
value>5, and 'False' if any of those values<5. You can use AND function to do that.

41) How cell reference is useful in the calculation?

In order to avoid writing the data again and again for calculating purpose, cell reference is used. When you write any formula, for specific function, 
you need to direct Excel the specific location of that data. This location is referred as, cell reference. So, every time a new value added to the cell, 
the cell will calculate according to the reference cell formula.
