Step definition maps the Test Case Steps in the feature files to code. It executes the steps on Application Under Test and checks the outcomes 
against expected results. In order to execute step definition it must match the given component in a feature.


<b>basic cucumber interview questions:</b>

Q #1) Explain Cucumber shortly.

Answer: Cucumber is a tool that is based on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodology.

The main aim of the Behavior Driven Development framework is to make various project roles such as Business Analysts, Quality Assurance, Developers, etc., understand the application without diving deep into the technical aspects.

Q #2) What language is used by Cucumber?

Answer: Gherkin is the language that is used by the Cucumber tool. It is a simple English representation of the application behavior. Gherkin language uses several keywords to describe the behavior of applications such as Feature, Scenario, Scenario Outline, Given, When, Then, etc.

Q #3) What is meant by a feature file?

Answer: A feature file must provide a high-level description of an Application Under Test (AUT). The first line of the feature file must start with the keyword ‘Feature’ followed by the description of the application under test.

A feature file may include multiple scenarios within the same file. A feature file has the extension .feature.

Q #4) What are the various keywords that are used in Cucumber for writing a scenario?

Answer: Mentioned below are the keywords that are used for writing a scenario:

Given
When
Then
And
Q #5) What is the purpose of a Scenario Outline in Cucumber?

Answer: Scenario outline is a way of parameterization of scenarios. This is ideally used when the same scenario needs to be executed for multiple sets of data, however, the test steps remain the same. Scenario Outline must be followed by the keyword ‘Examples’, which specify the set of values for each parameter.

Q #6) What programming language is used by Cucumber?

Answer: Cucumber tool provides support for multiple programming languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby etc. It can also be integrated with multiple tools such as Selenium, Capybara, etc.

Q #7) What is the purpose of the Step Definition file in Cucumber?

Answer: A step definition file in Cucumber is used to segregate the feature files from the underlying code. Each step of the feature file can be mapped to a corresponding method on the Step Definition file.

While feature files are written in an easily understandable language like, Gherkin, Step Definition files are written in programming languages such as Java, .Net, Ruby, etc.

Q #8) What are the major advantages of the Cucumber framework?

Answer: Given below are the advantages of the Cucumber Gherkin framework that make Cucumber an ideal choice for rapidly evolving Agile methodology in today’s corporate world.

Feature: Login to the application under test.
Scenario: Login to the application.

Open the Chrome browser and launch the application.
When the user enters the username onto the UserName field.
And User enters the password into the Password field.
When the user clicks on the Login button.
Then validate if the user login is successful.


Q #10) Provide an example of a Scenario Outline using the Cucumber framework.

Answer: The following is an example of a Scenario Outline keyword for the scenario ‘Upload a file’. The number of parameter values to be included in the feature file is based on the tester’s choice.

Scenario Outline: Upload a file

Given that the user is on upload file screen.
When a user clicks on the Browse button.
And user enters <filename> onto the upload textbox.
And user clicks on the enter button.
Then verify that the file upload is successful.

Example:

|filename|
|file1|
|file2|

Q #11) What is the purpose of the Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) methodology in the real world?

Answer: BDD is a methodology to understand the functionality of an application in the simple plain text representation.

The main aim of the Behavior Driven Development framework is to make various project roles such as Business Analysts, Quality Assurance, Developers, Support Teams understand the application without diving deep into the technical aspects.

Q #12) What is the limit for the maximum number of scenarios that can be included in the feature file?

Answer: A feature file can contain a maximum of 10 scenarios, but the number can vary from project to project and from one organization to another. But it is generally advisable to limit the number of scenarios included in the feature file.

Q #13) What is the use of Background keyword in Cucumber?

Answer: Background keyword is used to group multiple given statements into a single group. This is generally used when the same set of given statements are repeated in each scenario of the feature file.

Q #14) What symbol is used for parameterization in Cucumber?

Answer: Pipe symbol (|) is used to specify one or more parameter values in a feature file.

Q #15) What is the purpose of Examples keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Examples keyword is used to specify values for each parameter used in the scenario. Scenario Outline keyword must always be followed by the keyword Examples.

Q #16) What is the file extension for a feature file?

Answer: File Extension for a feature file is .feature. A feature file is ideally written in a notepad file and is saved with the extension feature.

Q #17) Provide an example of a step definition file in Cucumber.

Answer: Step definition corresponding to the step “Open Chrome browser and launch the application” may look like the code mentioned below:


<pre>@Given("^Open Chrome browser and launch the application$")
public void openBrowser()

{
driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.manage().window().maximize();
driver.get("www.facebook.com");
}</pre>


Q #18) What is the purpose of the Cucumber Options tag?

Answer: Cucumber Options tag is used to provide a link between the feature files and step definition files. Each step of the feature file is mapped to a corresponding method on the step definition file.

Below is the syntax of Cucumber Options tag:

<pre>@CucumberOptions(features="Features",glue={"StepDefinition"})</pre>

Q #19) How can Cucumber be integrated with Selenium WebDriver?

Answer: Cucumber can be integrated with the Selenium Webdriver by downloading the necessary JAR files.

1- General Selenium Webdriver Cucumber Interview Questions.
Q-1: What is a test framework?

In general, a framework is an entity which binds several modules in a logical sequence to cover the end-to-end flows of an application. The objective of investing in a framework is to test a product which has a recurring roadmap and regular release cycle.

 

Q-2: What are the apparent advantages of a test framework?

Following are the possible benefits of using a test framework.

1- It reduces the complexity of using a variety of technologies inculcated in a product.

2- It organizes the unit and functional testing efforts of a developer and tester.

3- Provides early feedback on the quality of the code.

4- Helps in tracking test coverage as well as code coverage.

5- Results in easy debugging and reduces chances of errors.

 

Q-3: What type of tests Selenium can run?

1- You can use Selenium for the functional, regression, and load testing of the web-based applications.

2- You can employ this tool for doing the post-release validation.

3- Integrate it with the continuous integration tools like Jenkins, Hudson, QuickBuild or CruiseControl.

The above two questions were a little basic which sometimes we miss explaining during the interview. So, we thought it was worth starting with them.

Moving down, you can see all the questions below are specific to the Selenium Webdriver Cucumber interview.

2- Basic Level Selenium Webdriver Cucumber Interview Questions.
Q-4: What are the prereqs for building a Selenium Cucumber automation framework?

You might like to consider the following facts while creating a productive and scalable test framework.

1- Identify the type of application you are going to test. Is it a Web app, support mobile devices or runs on a desktop.

2- Would it require backend testing? e.g. Databases or SDK.

3- Decide on the input format. Is it static or dynamic?

4- Do you need to test the app for internationalization?

5- It must have a report which can help you trace a failure with minimum efforts.

6- It must support the auto-generation of parametrization tests.

7- Have a config file to define any setup related settings or global properties.

8- Apply abstraction at every level to separate the functionality.

If you follow the above rules, then you’ll land up with a product which is easy to maintain and free to scale.

 

Q-5: List down the advantages of using Selenium as a testing tool?

1- It’s an open source, so you save a lot on the cost side.

2- It gives you options to choose from a list of programming languages. e.g. Java, Python, C-Sharp, Ruby, and Python.

3- It offers easy and powerful dom-level testing.

4- You can use it in either of Agile or waterfall environment.

5- Easy integration with Jenkins, Bamboo, and some other notable CI tools.

 

Q-6: List down the mobile device which Selenium supports?

1- It supports Safari browser via a third-party driver. It is experimental and comes with limited functionality.

2- It provides an Android driver to run tests on its native mobile browser.

 

3- Intermediate Level Selenium Webdriver Cucumber Interview Questions.
Q-7: How to integrate Cucumber with Selenium Webdriver?

It’s the most obvious Selenium Webdriver Cucumber interview question which you must know. And it’s better if you give a step by step reply to the interviewer. It’ll leave a positive impression on him as you’ll show the depth of your knowledge.

1- Cucumber is a testing framework to run acceptance test cases. It creates scripts using the BDD approach.

2- It makes use of a feature file which describes the test cases in plain text format.

3- Here you write tests in simple English. And later use the Selenium Webdriver to run the test scripts.

4- To start Cucumber with Selenium, first of all, you require creating a Maven project in Eclipse.

5- In the Maven’s POM file, you add the Cucumber dependency which brings the support of annotations like the <Given>, <When>, and <Then> and many other.


<pre class="lang:xhtml decode:true ">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;info.cukes&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;cucumber-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.1.5&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
 
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;info.cukes&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;cucumber-java&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.1.5&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
 
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;info.cukes&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;cucumber-junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.1.5&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>

6- Similarly, you can introduce the Selenium dependency into the above project. Alternatively, you can download the latest version of Selenium standalone jar from their website. And then, add to your project as an external jar file.

If you want to do it via the POM file, then add the following entry.

<pre class="lang:xhtml decode:true ">&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupid&gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium&lt;/groupid&gt;
  &lt;artifactid&gt;selenium-java&lt;/artifactid&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;2.53.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</pre>

Q-8: Are there any readymade Selenium-Cucumber frameworks available?

Yes, there are a few we are listing down below. Though, we recommend building one of your own as it gives you more freedom.

1- Selenium-Cucumber framework for testing the web and Android apps.

2- Another one is an acceptance testing framework using Cucumber and Selenium Webdriver.

4- Advanced Level Selenium Webdriver Cucumber Interview Questions.
Now Let’s start to discuss some of the internal Selenium Webdriver Cucumber interview questions.

Q-9: What are the two files which you need to run a Cucumber test scenario?

If you want to execute a Cucumber test, then make sure it has the following two files.

1- A feature file.

2- A step definition file.

 

Q-10: What does a feature file contain?

A feature file in cucumber specifies parameters and conditions for executing the test code. It can combine any of the following.

1- A feature.
2- A user scenario.
3- The scenario outline.
4- A <Given> clause.
5- A <When> clause.
6- A <Then> clause.

 

Q-11: What is a profile in cucumber?

You can create Cucumber profiles to run a set of features and step definitions. Use the following command to execute a cucumber profile.

<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">cucumber features -p &lt;profile_name&gt;

#Example: cucumber features -p acceptance</pre>

Q-12: What are before, after, beforeStep and afterStep hooks?

1- Before: executes before the feature file execution.

2- After: executes after the feature file execution.

3- BeforeStep: executes before each step execution.

4- AfterStep: executes after each step execution.

 

Q-13: What are cucumber tags? And why do we use them?

Cucumber tags help in filtering the scenarios. We can tag the scenarios and then run them based on tags.

1- We can add tags to scenarios with the <@> symbol.

2- We can use the following command to run a cucumber tagged scenario.


<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">cucumber features -t @&lt;tag_name&gt;

#Example: cucumber features -t @test</pre>


5- Expert Level Selenium Webdriver Cucumber Interview Questions.
Q-14: What is the purpose of cucumber dry-run?

We use to compile the cucumber feature files and step definitions. If there occur any compilation errors, then it shows them on the console.

 

Q-15: Why do you use the scenario outline?

We use it to execute the same scenario with different test data.

 

Q-16: What if you don’t use the cucumber keywords in test steps?

Please note that it’s not mandatory to write keywords in test steps.

For example, we can build a test step like the one shown in the next line.

e.g.- We are testing using Cucumber.

 

Q-17: List out some of the main differences between Jbehave and Cucumber?

However, the Cucumber and Jbehave share the same perspective, but there are few key differences.

1- Jbehave is Java-based and Cucumber is Ruby-based.

2- Jbehave is story-driven whereas the Cucumber is feature-driven.

 

Q-18: When would you use RSpec and when to use Cucumber?

1- RSpec is more successful in doing unit testing.

2- As you know that Cucumber is a behavior-driven development tool. So you can use it for System and Integration testing.

 

Q-19: What are the steps to generate a report in Cucumber?

We run the following command to produce HTML reports.

<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">cucumber &lt;featurename&gt;.feature --format html --out report.html --format pretty</pre>

Q-20: What is the right way to execute a specific scenario from the feature file?

We can select the target scenario from a feature file by providing its line number.

<pre class="lang:sh decode:true ">cucumber features/test.feature:10 --format html &gt; testfeature.html</pre>

<b>advanced cucumber interview questions:</b>


1 Explain about examples in Cucumber?

Examples are different sets of Inputs/Data. 

Given <I am a placeholder>

The placeholders in Given or then indicate that when the Examples row is run they should be substituted with real values from the Examples table.

 If a placeholder name is the same as a column title in the Examples table then this is the value that will replace it.

Given the input "<input>"

When the calculator is run

Then the output should be "<output>"

Examples:

| input | output |

| 2+2 | 4 |

| 98+1 | 99 |


2 Explain about and, but keywords in Cucumber?

“And” is used to combine two or more same type of action.

Cucumber steps beginning with “And” or “But” are exactly the same as all other steps.

Example:

      Given one thing

      And another thing

      When I open my eyes

      Then I see something

      But I don't see something else
	  
	  
3 How you will comment in Cucumber?

Cucumber allows you to precede Feature and Scenario keywords with comments.

Comments will be denoted with #

Example

# This is a feature

Feature: Adding

# This is Scenario

Scenario: Add two numbers

Given……..


4 What do you mean by grouping in Cucumber?

Cucumber will not take care how you name your step definition files and what step definitions you put in which file.

You can create steps.rb file for each Major operation / Features instead of keeping all steps in a single file. This process is called a grouping.

Example

Under features folder

Adding_steps.rb
Multiplying_steps.rb

5 What do you mean by tag in Cucumber?

Tags are the sticky notes you’ve put on pages you want to be able to find easily. 

You tag a scenario by putting a word prefixed with the @ character on the line before the Scenario keyword.

If you want to tag all the scenarios in a feature at once, just tag the Feature element at the top, and all the scenarios will inherit the tag.

You can attach multiple tags to the same scenario, separated with spaces.

Example

@adding @two @numbers

Feature: Adding

@add 

Scenario Outline: Add two numbers

6  How can you generate reports using Cucumber?

You can generate the output/report of the cucumber using different cucumber commands.

>cucumber adding.feature --format HTML 

>cucumber adding.feature --out report.html 

>cucumber adding.feature --format pretty

The report file will be stored in the project folder itself.

7 What is the use of Step definition files?

Step definition maps the test case steps in the feature files(introduced by Given/When/Then) to code which executes and checks the outcomes from the system under test.

A step definition is analogous to a method defined in any kind of Object Oriented programming language.

Step definition is defined in ruby files under features/step_definitions/*_steps.rb".

8 How can you get colored output (cucumber results) in command prompt?

Ansicon is used to give colored output for features, Step definitions, Errors, and test results.

Download the ansicon and select 32 bit/64 bit depends upon your system configuration.

9 How many spoken language cucumber supports?

Cucumber supports over 40 spoken languages and the number is still growing.

Using the #language: header, you can write your features in different spoken languages. 

Add it on the first line of a feature file will tell us which spoken language cucumber is using.

Example

# language: en

Feature: This is Feature title

10 Explain successful steps in Cucumber?

When Cucumber finds a matching Step Definition it will execute it. If the block in the step definition doesn’t raise an Exception, the step is marked as successful (green).

11 Explain undefined steps in Cucumber?

When Cucumber can’t find a matching Step Definition the step gets marked as yellow, and all subsequent steps in the scenario are skipped.

12  Define pending steps in Cucumber?

When a Step Definition’s Proc invokes the pending method, the step is marked as yellow (as with undefined ones), reminding you that you have work to do.

13  Explain skipped steps in Cucumber?

Steps that follow undefined, pending or failed steps are never executed (even if there is a matching Step Definition) and are marked cyan.  

14  Name some reporting tools to be used with Cucumber?

You can use report tools like Jenkins or bamboo tool.
**********************************************************************

1 How Cucumber is used in Acceptance Testing?

In Software engineering, acceptance testing is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification are met or not. Instead of a business stakeholder passing requirements to the development team, the developer and stakeholder collaborate to write automated tests that express the outcome that the stakeholder wants.

Cucumber is a tool based on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework which is used to write acceptance tests for a web application.

2 What do you mean by BDD?

Behavior-driven development – in short BDD

Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.

TDD practitioners work from the outside-in, starting with a failing customer acceptance test that describes the behavior of the system from the customer’s point of view.

3 What is Cucumber?

Cucumber is a tool based on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework which is used to write acceptance tests for a web application. It is written in Ruby.

It allows automation of functional validation in an easily readable and understandable format like plain English. Cucumber can be used along with Selenium, Watir, and Capybara etc.

Cucumber supports many other languages like Perl, PHP, Python, Java etc.


4 Explain how Cucumber works?

A cucumber is a command-line tool. When you run it, 

It reads in your specifications from plain-language text files called features files.
Along with the features, you give Cucumber a set of step definitions, which map the business-readable language of each step into Ruby code.
Once all the steps are added run the cucumber again to get the passed test cases or failed test cases.
Repeat the steps until all the test cases are being passed. 	

5 What are the advantages of a Cucumber?

Cucumber tool has a lot of advantages.

It is helpful to involve business stakeholders who can't easily read a code.
Cucumber focuses on end-user experience.
Style of writing tests allows for easier reuse of code in the tests.
Quick and easy setup and execution.
An efficient tool for testing

6 Explain about the Directory Layout of the Cucumber Project?

features - folder has all .feature files
step_definitions - folder has all step definitions files
support – folder has all the supported modules/libraries/files
Gemfile - list of Rubygems(optional)
Test results – folder has all the reports generated(optional)

7 What are the parts of the feature folder?

Cucumber tests are grouped into features. Features give information about the high-level business functionality and the purpose of Application under test. Feature files are get stored here.

Feature folder has two subfolders

step_definitions - folder has all step definitions files
support – folder has all the supported modules/libraries/files

8 Explain about the feature file?

Feature files are an essential part of cucumber which is used to write test automation steps or acceptance tests. This can be used as a live document. The steps are the application specification. All the feature files end with .feature extension.

9 What is the use of Regular Expressions in Cucumber?

Cucumber uses expressions to link a Gherkin Step to a Step Definition. You can use Regular Expressions or Cucumber Expressions.

Regular expressions are handy to filter/find a specific matching pattern in any text.  

Cucumber Expressions offer similar functionality to Regular Expressions, with a syntax that is easier to read and write.

10 Explain about Scenario?

what to do. By seeing the scenario user should be able to understand the intent behind the scenario and what the test is all about.

Each scenario should follow given, when and then format.

Example

Feature: Subtraction

Scenario: Subtracting two numbers

11 What do you mean by Gherkin?

Gherkin is the language that Cucumber uses to define test cases. It is designed to be non-technical and human-readable, and collectively describes use cases relating to a software system. It is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language (DSL).

Gherkin gives two purposes in Cucumber

Documentation 
Automated tests


12 Give the structure of the Gherkin File?

A Gherkin file is given its structure and meaning using a set of special keywords.

Feature

13 What is the use of Scenario outline in a feature file?

Scenario outline is a way of parameterization of scenarios. Scenario outlines are used when the same test has to be performed with different data set, however, the test steps remain the same. 

Scenario Outline must be followed by the keyword ‘Examples’, which specify the set of values for each parameter.

Example

Feature: Subtracting

Scenario Outline: Subtracting any two numbers

Whenever any step is required to perform in each scenario then those steps need to be placed in Background. Background generally has the instruction on what to set up before each scenario runs.

Feature: Subtracting

Background: The calculator should be reset to 0.

Scenario Outline: Subtracting two numbers

15 Explain the given keyword in Cucumber?

“Given” specifies the pre-conditions. It is basically a known state.

The purpose of givens is to put the system in a known state before the user starts interacting with the system.

Example

Given the input "<input>"

When the calculator is run

Then the output should be "<output>"

16 Explain when keyword in Cucumber?

The purpose of “When” is to describe the key action the user performs.

In other words “When” is used when some action is to be performed.

Example

Given the input "<input>"

When the calculator is run

Then the output should be "<output>"

17 Explain about then keyword in Cucumber?

The expected outcome or result should be placed here. The purpose of “Then” steps is to observe outcomes. The observations should be related to the business value/benefit in your feature description. The observations should also be on some kind of output.

Example

Given the input "<input>"

When the calculator is run

Then the output should be "<output>"
