It is helpful to involve business stakeholders who can't easily read the code
Cucumber Testing enhances the end-user experience
Style of writing tests allow for easier reuse of code in the tests
Allows quick and easy setup and execution
20) What is a Step Definition?

Step definition maps the Test Case Steps in the feature files to code. It executes the steps on Application Under Test and checks the outcomes 
against expected results. In order to execute step definition it must match the given component in a feature.


<b>basic cucumber interview questions:</b>

Q #1) Explain Cucumber shortly.

Answer: Cucumber is a tool that is based on Behavior Driven Development (BDD) methodology.

The main aim of the Behavior Driven Development framework is to make various project roles such as Business Analysts, Quality Assurance, Developers, etc., understand the application without diving deep into the technical aspects.

Q #2) What language is used by Cucumber?

Answer: Gherkin is the language that is used by the Cucumber tool. It is a simple English representation of the application behavior. Gherkin language uses several keywords to describe the behavior of applications such as Feature, Scenario, Scenario Outline, Given, When, Then, etc.

Q #3) What is meant by a feature file?

Answer: A feature file must provide a high-level description of an Application Under Test (AUT). The first line of the feature file must start with the keyword ‘Feature’ followed by the description of the application under test.

A feature file may include multiple scenarios within the same file. A feature file has the extension .feature.

Q #4) What are the various keywords that are used in Cucumber for writing a scenario?

Answer: Mentioned below are the keywords that are used for writing a scenario:

Given
When
Then
And
Q #5) What is the purpose of a Scenario Outline in Cucumber?

When the user enters the username onto the UserName field.
And User enters the password into the Password field.
When the user clicks on the Login button.
Then validate if the user login is successful.


Q #10) Provide an example of a Scenario Outline using the Cucumber framework.

Answer: The following is an example of a Scenario Outline keyword for the scenario ‘Upload a file’. The number of parameter values to be included in the feature file is based on the tester’s choice.

Scenario Outline: Upload a file

Given that the user is on upload file screen.
When a user clicks on the Browse button.
And user enters <filename> onto the upload textbox.
And user clicks on the enter button.
Then verify that the file upload is successful.

Example:

|filename|
|file1|
|file2|

Q #11) What is the purpose of the Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) methodology in the real world?

Answer: BDD is a methodology to understand the functionality of an application in the simple plain text representation.

The main aim of the Behavior Driven Development framework is to make various project roles such as Business Analysts, Quality Assurance, Developers, Support Teams understand the application without diving deep into the technical aspects.

Q #12) What is the limit for the maximum number of scenarios that can be included in the feature file?

Answer: A feature file can contain a maximum of 10 scenarios, but the number can vary from project to project and from one organization to another. But it is generally advisable to limit the number of scenarios included in the feature file.

Q #13) What is the use of Background keyword in Cucumber?

Answer: Background keyword is used to group multiple given statements into a single group. This is generally used when the same set of given statements are repeated in each scenario of the feature file.

Q #14) What symbol is used for parameterization in Cucumber?

Answer: Pipe symbol (|) is used to specify one or more parameter values in a feature file.

Q #15) What is the purpose of Examples keyword in Cucumber?

Ans: Examples keyword is used to specify values for each parameter used in the scenario. Scenario Outline keyword must always be followed by the keyword Examples.

Q #16) What is the file extension for a feature file?

Answer: File Extension for a feature file is .feature. A feature file is ideally written in a notepad file and is saved with the extension feature.

Q #17) Provide an example of a step definition file in Cucumber.

Answer: Step definition corresponding to the step “Open Chrome browser and launch the application” may look like the code mentioned below:


<pre>@Given("^Open Chrome browser and launch the application$")
public void openBrowser()

{
driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.manage().window().maximize();
driver.get("www.facebook.com");
}</pre>


Q #18) What is the purpose of the Cucumber Options tag?

Answer: Cucumber Options tag is used to provide a link between the feature files and step definition files. Each step of the feature file is mapped to a corresponding method on the step definition file.

Below is the syntax of Cucumber Options tag:

<pre>@CucumberOptions(features="Features",glue={"StepDefinition"})</pre>

Q #19) How can Cucumber be integrated with Selenium WebDriver?

2- Basic Level Selenium Webdriver Cucumber Interview Questions.
Q-4: What are the prereqs for building a Selenium Cucumber automation framework?

You might like to consider the following facts while creating a productive and scalable test framework.

1- Identify the type of application you are going to test. Is it a Web app, support mobile devices or runs on a desktop.

2- Would it require backend testing? e.g. Databases or SDK.

3- Decide on the input format. Is it static or dynamic?

4- Do you need to test the app for internationalization?

5- It must have a report which can help you trace a failure with minimum efforts.

6- It must support the auto-generation of parametrization tests.

7- Have a config file to define any setup related settings or global properties.

8- Apply abstraction at every level to separate the functionality.

If you follow the above rules, then you’ll land up with a product which is easy to maintain and free to scale.

 

Q-5: List down the advantages of using Selenium as a testing tool?

1- It’s an open source, so you save a lot on the cost side.

2- It provides an Android driver to run tests on its native mobile browser.

 

3- Intermediate Level Selenium Webdriver Cucumber Interview Questions.
Q-7: How to integrate Cucumber with Selenium Webdriver?

It’s the most obvious Selenium Webdriver Cucumber interview question which you must know. And it’s better if you give a step by step reply to the interviewer. It’ll leave a positive impression on him as you’ll show the depth of your knowledge.

1- Cucumber is a testing framework to run acceptance test cases. It creates scripts using the BDD approach.

2- It makes use of a feature file which describes the test cases in plain text format.

3- Here you write tests in simple English. And later use the Selenium Webdriver to run the test scripts.

4- To start Cucumber with Selenium, first of all, you require creating a Maven project in Eclipse.

5- In the Maven’s POM file, you add the Cucumber dependency which brings the support of annotations like the <Given>, <When>, and <Then> and many other.
