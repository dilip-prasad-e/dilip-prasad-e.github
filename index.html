<b id="GN__DatabaseTesting_interview_questions:">GN__DatabaseTesting_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>


1) What is Database Testing?

Database Testing is also known as Backend Testing. Database Testing is segmented into four different categories.

Testing of Data Integrity
Testing of Data Validity
Data base related performance
Testing of functions, procedure and triggers
2) In database testing, what do we need to check normally?

Normally, the things that we check in DB Testing are:

Constraint Check
Validation of a Field size
Stored procedure
Matching application field size to database
Indexes for performance based issues
3) Explain what is data driven test?

In a data-table, to test the multi numbers of data, data-driven test is used. By using this it can easily replace the 
parameters at the same time from different locations.

4) What are joins and mention different types of joins?

Join is used to display two or more than two table and the types of joins are:

Natural Join
Inner Join
Outer Join
Cross Join
The outer join is divided again in two:

Left outer join
Right outer join
5) What are indexes and mention different types of indexes?

Indexes are database objects and they are created on columns. To fetch data quickly they are frequently accessed. 
Different types of indexes are:

B-Tree index
Bitmap index
Clustered index
Covering index
Non-unique index
Unique index
6) While testing stored procedures what are the steps does a tester takes?

The tester will check the standard format of the stored procedures and also it checks the fields are correct like 
updates, joins, indexes, deletions as mentioned in the stored procedure.

7) How would you know for database testing, whether trigger is fired or not?

On querying the common audit log you would know, whether, a trigger is fired or not. It is in audit log where you 
can see the triggers fired.

8) In data base testing, what are the steps to test data loading?

Following steps need to follow to test data loading

Source data should be known
Target data should be known
Compatibility of source and target should be checked
In SQL Enterprise manager, run the DTS package after opening the corresponding DTS package
You have to compare the columns of target and data source
Number of rows of target and source should be checked
After updating data in the source, check whether the changes appears in the target or not.
Check NULLs and junk characters
9) Without using Database Checkpoints, how you test a SQL Query in QTP?

By writing scripting procedure in VBScript, we can connect to database and can test the queries and database.

10) Explain how to use SQL queries in QTP ?

In QTP using output database check point and database check, you have to select the SQL manual queries option. 
After selecting the manual queries option, enter the "select" queries to fetch the data in the database and then 
compare the expected and actual.

11) What is the way of writing testcases for database testing?

Writing a testcases is like functional testing. First you have to know the functional requirement of the application. 
Then you have to decide the parameters for writing testcases like

Objective: Write the objective that you would like to test
Input method: Write the method of action or input you want to execute
Expected: how it should appear in the database
12) To manage and manipulate the test table what are the SQL statements that you have used in Database testing?

The statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE are used to manipulate the table, while ALTER TABLE, CREATE TABLE 
and DELETE TABLE are used to manage table.

13) How to test database procedures and triggers?

To test database procedures and triggers, input and output parameters must be known. EXEC statement can be used to run 
the procedure and examine the behaviour of the tables.

Open the database project in solution explorer
Now in View menu, click the database schema
Open the project folder from schema View menu
Right click on the object that has to be tested, and then click on the dialog box that says Create Unit Tests
After that create a new language test project
Select either a) Insert the unit test or b) Create a new test and then click OK
Project that has to be configured will be done by clicking on the Project Configuration dialog box.
Once it configured click on OK
14) How you can write testcases from requirements and do the requirements represents exact functionality of AUT (Application Under Test)?

To write a testcases from requirements, you need to analyse the requirements thoroughly in terms of functionality. Thereafter 
you think about the appropriate testcases design techniques like Equivalence partitioning, Black box design, Cause effect 
graphing etc. for writing the testcases.Yes, the requirements represent exact functionality of AUT.

DBMS stand for Database management system, there are different types of DBMS

Network Model
Hierarchical Model
Relational Model
16) What is DML?

DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, It is used to manage data with schema objects. It is a subset of SQL.

17) What are DCL commands? What are the two types of commands used by DCL?

DCL stands for Data Control Language, it is used to control data.

The two types of DCL Commands are:

Grant: By using this command user can access privilege to database

Revoke: By using this command user cannot access the database

18) What is white box testing and black box testing?

Black box testing means testing the software for the outputs on giving particular inputs. This testing is usually performed 
to see if the software meets the user's requirements. There is no specific functional output expected for running this test.

The white box testing is done to check the accuracy of code and logic of the program. This testing is done by the programmer 
who knows the logical flow of the system.

19) How does QTP evaluate test results?

Once the testing is done, QTP will generate a report. This report will show the checkpoints, system message and error that 
were detected while testing. The test results window will show any mismatches encountered at the checkpoints.

20) Explain the QTP testing process?

QTP testing process is based on following steps:
Creating GUI (Graphical User Interface) Map files : Identifies the GUI object which has to be tested
Creating test scripts: Test scripts are recorded
Debug tests: Test should be debugged
Run tests: Testcases should be run.
View results: The results reflects the success or failure of the tests
Report detects: If the test is failed, the reasons will be recorded in the report detect file
21) What is load testing and give some examples of it?

To measure the system response, load testing is done. If the load exceeds the users pattern it is known as stress testing. 
Examples of load testing are downloading the set of large files, executing multiple applications on a single computer, 
subjecting a server to large number of e-mails and allotting many tasks to a printer one after another.

22) How to test database manually?

Testing the database manually involves checking the data at the back end and to see whether the addition of data in front 
end is affecting the back end or not, and same for delete, update, insert etc.

23) What RDBMS stands for and what are the important RDMBS that SQL use?

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management Systems that use SQL, and the important RDBMS that SQL uses are Sybase, 
Oracle, Access ,Ingres, Microsoft SQL server etc.

24) What is performance testing and what are the bottlenecks of performance testing?

Performance testing determines the speed of the computer system performance. It includes the quantitative tests like 
response time measurement. The problem in performance testing is that you always need a well-trained and experienced man 
power also the tools you use are expensive.

25) What is DDL and what are their commands?

To define database structure, a Developer uses DDL. DDL stands for Data Definition Language. The various DDL commands 
include Create, Truncate, Drop, Alter, Comment and Rename.

<b id="GN__Appium_interview_questions:">GN__Appium_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

1) Explain what is Appium?

Appium is a freely distributed open source mobile application UI Testing framework.

2) List out the Appium abilities?

Appium abilities are

Test Web
Provides cross-platform for Native and Hybrid mobile automation
Support JSON wire protocol
It does not require recompilation of App
Support automation test on physical device as well as similar or emulator both
It has no dependency on mobile device
3) List out the pre-requisite to use APPIUM?

Pre-requisite to use APPIUM is

ANDROID SDK
JDK
TestNG
Eclipse
Selenium Server JAR
Webdriver Language Binding Library
APPIUM for Windows
APK App Info On Google Play
js
4) List out the limitations of using Appium?

Appium does not support testing of Android Version lower than 4.2
Limited support for hybrid app testing. E.g., not possible to test the switching action of application from the web app to 
native and vice-versa
No support to run Appium Inspector on Microsoft Windows
5) Explain how to find DOM element or xPath in a mobile application?

To find the DOM element use "UIAutomateviewer" to find DOM element for Android application.

6) Explain the design concept of Appium?

Appium is an "HTTP Server" written using Node.js platform and drives iOS and Android session using Webdriver JSON wire protocol. 
Hence, before initializing the Appium Server, Node.js must be pre-installed on the system
When Appium is downloaded and installed, then a server is setup on our machine that exposes a REST API
It receives connection and command request from the client and execute that command on mobile devices (Android / iOS)
It responds back with HTTP responses. Again, to execute this request, it uses the mobile test automation frameworks to drive 
the user interface of the apps. Framework like
Apple Instruments for iOS (Instruments are available only in Xcode 3.0 or later with OS X v10.5 and later)
Google UIAutomator for Android API level 16 or higher
Selendroid for Android API level 15 or less
7) What language does Appium support?

Appium support any language that support HTTP request like Java, JavaScript with Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, etc.

8) Explain the pros and cons of Appium?

Pros:

For programmer irrespective of the platform, he is automating ( Android or iOS) all the complexities will remain under single Appium server
It opens the door to cross-platform mobile testing which means the same test would work on multiple platforms
Appium does not require extra components in your App to make it automation friendly
It can automate Hybrid, Web and Native mobile applications
Cons:

Running scripts on multiple iOS simulators at the same time is possible with Appium
It uses UIAutomator for Android Automation which supports only Android SDK platform, API 16 or higher and to support the older API's 
they have used another open source library called Selendroid
9) Explain what is APPIUM INSPECTOR?

Similar to Selenium IDE record and Playback tool, Appium has an "Inspector" to record and playback. It records and plays native 
application behavior by inspecting DOM and generates the test scripts in any desired language. However, Appium Inspector does not 
support Windows and use UIAutomator viewer in its option.

10) Mention what are the basic requirement for writing Appium tests?

For writing Appium tests you require,

Driver Client: Appium drives mobile applications as though it were a user. Using a client library you write your Appium tests which 
wrap your test steps and sends to the Appium server over HTTP.
Appium Session: You have to first initialize a session, as such Appium test takes place in the session. Once the Automation is done 
for one session, it can be ended and wait for another session
Desired Capabilities: To initialize an Appium session you need to define certain parameters known as "desired capabilities" like 
PlatformName, PlatformVersion, Device Name and so on. It specifies the kind of automation one requires from the Appium server.
Driver Commands: You can write your test steps using a large and expressive vocabulary of commands.
11) Mention what are the possible errors one might encounter using Appium?

The possible errors one might face in Appium includes

Error 1: The following desired capabilities are needed but not provided: Device Name, platformName
Error 2: Could not find adb. Please set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable with the Android SDK root directory path
Error 3: openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: A new session could not be created
Error 4: How to find DOM element or XPath in a mobile application?
12) Do you need a server machine to run tests on Appium?

No, you don't need server machine to run tests on Appium. Appium facilitates a 2-tier architecture where a test machine connects to a 
test server running Appium and automating the whole thing. You can have Appium running on the same machine where your test runs.

13) Is it possible to interact with my apps using Javascript while I am testing with Appium?

Yes, it is possible to interact with App while using Javascript. When the commands run on Appium, the server will send the script to 
your app wrapped into an anonymous function to be executed.

14) Mention what are the most difficult scenarios to test with Appium?

The most difficult scenario to test with Appium is data exchange.

15) While using Appium can I run my tests in a multithreaded environment?

Yes, you can run the test in a multithreaded environment but you have to ensure that no more than one test runs at the same time 
against the same Appium server.

16) In Android, do you need an app's .apk to automate using Appium or you also need app in my workspace?

In Android, you only need .apk file to automate using Appium.

17) Explain what is Appium package master? How to create package?

Appium package master is a set of tools manage and create appium packages. For example to create package you can use the code

# using es7/babe1

Gulp create-package -n <package-name>

#regular es5

Gulp create-package ---nobabe1 -n <package-name>

The package will be generated in the out/<package-name>

18) Explain how test frameworks are supported by Appium?

Appium does not support test framework as such there is no need to support them. Appium can be used with any frameworks you want.

<b id="GN__QTP/UFT_interview_questions:">GN__QTP/UFT_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

1) What are the types object Repositories in Micro Focus UFT.

QTP Supports 2 types of Object Repository

1) Shared Object Repository (also called Global)

2) Per-Action Object Repository, (also called Local)

Per-Action Object Repository is used by default. The extension for Per-Action repository is ".mtr" .

Shared Object Repository is preferable while dealing with dynamic objects which are called in multiple tests. The extension is ".tsr"

2) Which environments are supported by HP QTP?

QTP supports the following environments

Active X
Delphi
Java
.Net
Oracle
People Soft
Power Builder
SAP
Siebel
Stingray
Terminal Emulator
Visual Basic
Visual Age
Web
Web Services
To learn more about Add-ins and how to use them, watch this video tutorial.

3) Can we call QTP test from another test using scripting. Suppose there are 4 tests and I want to call these tests in a main script. 
Is this possible in QTP?

Yes.  You can call 4 or even more scripts in your tests.For this, first you will need to make the Actions in the corresponding scripts 
re-usable.Then from the destination script you can make calls to these re-usable actions.

4) What is action split and the purpose of using this in QTP?

Action split is to divide an existing action into two parts.The purpose is to divide actions based on their functionality to improve code 
re-use.

5) How will you handle Java tree in QTP?

Foremost you will select Java Add - In and launch QTP. Next step record operations on the Java Tree. If you face an issue while recording, 
you can select Tools > Object Identification > Java, tree object and make changes in mandatory and assistive properties to enable identification.

Tip: You can base you answer on similar lines for any other object of any environment. For example : If the question is how will check SAP 
checkbox , You say , first I will select SAP Add in ... and so on.

6) Explain how QTP identifies object?

QTP identifies any GUI Object based on its corresponding properties.  While recording, QTP will identify and store peculiar properties (as defined 
in the Object Identification settings) in the object repository of the GUI object . At run-time, QTP will compare the stored property values with 
the on-screen properties, to uniquely identify the GUI object.


7) How many types of recording modes in QTP? Which will be used when?

QTP supports 3 types of recording modes  

1. Normal mode also called Contextual

2. Low-level recording mode

3.Analog mode

Normal Mode: It is the default recording mode and takes full advantage of QTP's Test Object Model. It recognizes objects regardless of their 
position on -screen. This is the preferred mode of recoding and is used for most of the automation activities.

Low-level recording mode: This mode records the exact x,y co-ordinates of your mouse operations. It is helpful in testing hashmaps. It is 
useful for recording objects not identified by normal mode of QTP.

Analog mode: This mode records exact mouse and keyboard "movements" you perform in relation to the screen / application window. This mode 
is useful for the operation such as drawing a picture, recording signature., drag and drop operations.

Learn more about Recording Modes in QTP

8) How will you  call from one action to another action?

We can call an action in 2 ways

1) Call to copy of Action. - In this ,the Action Object Repository , Script and Datable will be copied to the destination Test Script.
2) Call to Existing Action. - In this,  Object Repository , Script and Datable  will NOT be copied but a call (reference) would be made to the 
Action in the source script.

9) What are Virtual Objects?

Your application may contain objects that behave like standard objects but are not recognized by QTP. You can define these objects as virtual 
objects and map them to standard classes, such as a button or a check box. QTP emulates the user's action on the virtual object during the run 
session. In the test results, the virtual object is displayed as though it is a standard class object.

For example, suppose you want to record a test on a Web page containing a bitmap that the user clicks. The bitmap contains several different 
hyperlink areas, and each area opens a different destination page. When you record a test, the Web site matches the coordinates of the click 
on the bitmap and opens the destination page.

To enable QTP to click at the required coordinates during a run session, you can define a virtual object for an area of the bitmap, which 
includes those coordinates, and map it to the button class. When you run a test, QTP clicks the bitmap in the area defined as a virtual 
object so that the Web site opens the correct destination page.

10) How to perform Cross platform testing and Cross browser testing using QTP? Can u explain giving some example?

You will need to create separate Actions which take care of different OS and Browsers

Cross Platform Testing:

Using the Built in Environment Variable you can dig up the OS information.

Eg. Platform = Environment("OS"). Then based on the Platform you need to call the actions which you recorded on that particular platform.

Cross Browser Testing:

Using this code  Eg. Browser("Core Values").GetROProperty("version") you can extract the Browser and its correspondin version. Ex: Internet 
Explorer 6 or Netscape 5. Based on this value you call the actions which are relevant to that browser.

11) What is logical name of the object?

Logical name is a name  given by  QTP while creating an object in the repository to uniquely identify it from other objects in the application. 
This name would be used by the QTP to map the object name in script with its corresponding description in the object repository. Ex: Browser
("Browser").Page("Guru99") Here Guru99 is the logical name of the object.

12) What is descriptive programming?

Typically ,an object and its properties must be recorded in the Object Repository to enable QTP to perform action s on it. 

Using descriptive programming , you do not store the object and its property values in the Object repository but mention the property value 
pair directly in the script.

The idea behind descriptive programming is not bypass the object repository but help recogonize dynamic objects.

Learn more about Descriptive Programming

13)What are the properties you would use for identifying a browser & page when using descriptive programming?

You can use the name property

ex: Browser("name:="xxx"").page("name:="xxxx"").....  

OR

We can also use the property "micClass".

ex: Browser("micClass:=browser").page("micClass:=page")....

14)Can we record an application running on a remote machine using QTP?

Yes .you can record remote application provided you are accessing application through the local browser not via remoter like citrix.


If you are still unable to record it is advisable install QTP and application, on the same machine

15) Explain the keyword CreateObject with an example.

Creates and returns a reference to an Automation object

SYNTAX: CreateObject(servername.typename [, location])

Arguments

servername: Required. The name of the application providing the object.

typename :  Required. The type or class of the object to create.

location :  Optional. The name of the network server where the object is to be created.

Example : Set IE = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application")

16) Can you switch between Per-Action and Shared Object Repository? If yes how?

Yes .We can switch. Go to Test--->Settings--->Resources. Here  you have an option to choose repositories.

17) What is Object Spy ? How to Use it?

Object Spy helps in determining the run & test time object properties & methods of the application under test.

You can access object spy directly from the toolbar or from the Object Repository Dialog Box.

It is very useful during Descriptive Programming

Learn more about Object Spy

18) When ordinal identifiers alone can make an object unique then why they are not given top priority? Why it is first mandatory and 
next assistive. Why we cannot go for ordinal identifiers directly?

Consider the following -

a) If two objects are overlapped on each other than location based object recognition will fail.

b) If only index based recognition is used your script will work but script execution time will increase.

Hence mandatory and assistive properties are used.

19) What is the file extension of the code file in QTP?

Code file extension is script.mts

20) Explain in brief about the QTP Automation Object Model.

QTP Automation Object model deals with Automation of QTP itself. Almost all configuration and functionality provided by QTP is represented 
by QTP's Automation Object Model . Almost all dialog boxes in QTP have a corresponding automation object which can set or retrieved using 
the corresponding properties or methods in the Automation Object Model.QTP Automation Objects can be used along with standard VB programming 
elements like iterative loops or conditional statements to help you design a script of choice.

21) What is the use of Text output value in QTP?

Text Output values enable you to capture text appearing on the application under test during run-time.

If parameterized, text output values will capture values appearing in each iteration which would be stored in the run-time data table for 
further analysis.

22) What is Step Generator?

Step Generator enables use to Add Test Steps in your script. Using step generator you can add steps to your script without actually recording it.

23) How to make QTP understand the difference amongst the  same type of objects .Suppose there are 5 check boxes in a page and I have to 
choose the 2nd one, how to do that through script?

You can use ordinal identifiers like index along with a little descriptive programming for object recognition.

Watch a video of this example.

24) What is Test Fusion Report?

Test Fusion Report , displays all aspects of a test run and is organized in a Tree format.

It gives details of each step executed for all iterations.

It also gives Run-time data table, Screen shots and movie of the test run if opted.

25) How can you handle exceptions in QTP?

In QTP Exceptional handling is done by using

a. Recovery Scenarios.
b. Using "On Error" statement

In Recovery scenario you have to define.
1. Triggered Events.
2. Recovery steps.
3. Post Recovery Test-Run.

At Script Level you can use the On Error Resume Next and On Error Go to 0 statement.

26) What are the types of environment variables in QTP?

Environment variables in QTP are of three types:

1) Built-in (Read only)

2) User-defined Internal (Read only)

3) User-defined External (Read/Write)

You Set the Environment Variable  using the following syntax 

Environment.Value( "name") = "Guru99"

You can Retrieve the Environment Variable using following syntax

Environment.Value("name") -- This will retrun name as Guru99

Environment.Value("OS")  -- This will return your system OS

27) What is the Difference between Bitmap Check point & Image Check point? Bitmap checkpoint does a pixel to pixel comparison of an image 
or part of an image.

Image checkpoint does do a pixel to pixel comparison but instead compare image properties like alt text , destination url etc.

28) What is the difference between functions and actions in QTP?

Actions have their own Object Repository & Data Table. Actions help make your Test modular and increase reuse. Example: You can divide your 
script into Actions based on functionality like Login, Logout etc.

Functions is a VB Script programming concept and do not have their own Object Repository or Data Table. Functions help in re-use of your 
code. Ex:  You can create a Function in your script to concatenate two strings.

29) What is keyword view and Expert view in QTP? 

Keyword View is an icon based view which shows test steps in tabular format. It also automatically generates documentation for the test steps.

Expert View gives the corresponding VB Script statement for every test step in the Keyword view.

30)  Explain QTP Testing process?

Quick Test testing process consists of 6 main phases:

1)  Create your test plan - This is preparatory phase where you identify the exact test steps, test data and expected results for you 
automated test. You also identify the environment and system configurations required to create and run your QTP Tests.

2) Recording a session on your application - During this phase , you will execute test steps one by one on your AUT ,and QTP will 
automatically record corresponding VB script statements for each step performed.

3) Enhancing your test - In this stage you will insert checkpoints , output values , parameterization , programming logic like if...else 
loops to enhance the logic of your test script.

4) Replay & Debug - After enhancements you will replay the script to check whether its working properly and debug if necessary.

5) Run your Tests - In this phase you will perform the actual execution of your Test Script.

6) Analyzing the test results - Once test run is complete, you will analyze the results in the Test Fusion report generated.

7) Reporting defects - Any incidents identified needs to be reported. If you are using Quality Center , defects can be automatically 
raised for failed tests in QTP.

31) What are the different types of Test Automation Frameworks?

The types of Automation Frameworks are -

1) Linear Scripting - Record & Playback

2) The Test Library Architecture Framework.

3)The Data-Driven Testing Framework.

4)The Keyword-Driven or Table-Driven Testing Framework.

Learn more about Test Automation Frameworks.

32) How will you check a web application for broken links using QTP?

You can use the Page Checkpoint which gives a count of valid/invalid links on a page.

33) What is a Run-Time Data Table? Where can I find and view this table?

Data like parameterized output , checkpoint values , output values  are stored in the Run-time Table. It is an xls file which is stored 
in the Test Results Folder.  It can also be accessed in the Test Fusion Report.

34) What is the difference between check point and output value.

Check point is a verification point that compares a current value for a specified property with the expected value for that property. 
Based on this comparison, it will generate a PASS or FAIL status. 

An output value is a value captured during the test run and can be stored in a specified location like the  Datable or even a variable. 
Unlike Checkpoints, no PASS/FAIL status is generated.

35) How would you connect to database using VBScript?

To connect to the database you must know

a) connection string of your server

b) username

c) password

d) DNS name

You can code the database connectivity command directly or you can use the SQL Query tool provided by QTP.

36) What is QTP batch testing tool?

 You can use the Batch testing tool to run multiple scripts. Once the scripts are added in the tool , it  will automatically open the 
 scripts and start executing them one after the other.

37) What are the drawbacks of QTP?

As of QTP version 10

1) Huge Tests in QTP consume lots of memory and increase CPU utilization.

2) Since QTP stores results in HTML file (and not txt) the result folder sometimes becomes big.

38) What is an Optional Step?

A step when declared optional is not mandatory to be executed. If the corresponding GUI object is present, QTP performs the operation 
on it. If the GUI object is not present, QTP bypasses the optional step and proceeds to execute the next step.

39) What  is Reporter.ReportEvent?

Reporter.Reportvent is standard method provided by QTP to send custom messages to the test results window.

Syntax

Reporter.ReportEvent EventStatus, ReportStepName, Details [, ImageFilePath]

where     

EventStatus = 0 or micPass

                    1 or micFail

                    2 or micDone

                    3 or micWarning

 Results can assume any status like Pass , Fail , Warning etc. You can also send screenshot to the test results window.

40) How will you  declare a variable in QTP?

You declare using a DIM keyword. You assign value to the variable using the SET keyword.

Ex.

Dim temp 'Will declare the temp variable

Set  temp = 20 ' Will assign a value 20 to temp.

41) What is GetRoProperty?

 GetRoProperty is a standard method provided by QTP to fetch property values of a run -time object.

42) What is smart Identification?

Typically, if even one of the on-screen object property does not match the recorded object property. The test fails.

In smart identification, QTP does not give an error if the property values do not match, but uses Base filter and Optional Filter 
properties to uniquely identify an object. In Smart identification, if a property value does not match the script does not fail 
but it proceeds ahead to compare the next property. Smart identification can be enabled in Object Identification Dialog box.

Learn more about SMART Identification

43) How would you export a Script from one PC to another in QTP?

We can make use of the "Generate Script" function available in Object Identification, Test Settings and Tools/Options tab to create a 
zip of the script at the source computer. These zip files then can be imported into QTP at the destination computer.

44) Can launch two instances of QTP on the same machine?

No. You can work with only single instance of QTP on the same machine. But QTP itself can work on multiple instances of the Application 
Under Test (AUT). Ex:  QTP can handle multiple IE browser windows.

45) Give the syntax to import/export xls into QTP.

DataTable.ImportSheet "..\..\TestData\Input.xls",1,dtGlobalSheet

DataTable.ExportSheet "..\..\Results\Output.xls","Global"

46) What is SetToProperty?

SetToProperty changes property of an object stored in the Object Repository. However these changes are not permanent.

47) What is the standard timing delay for web based application in QTP?

The standard delay is 60 seconds. This is can be changed in Test Settigns.

48) What is the Action Conversion Tool?

It is an in-built tool provided by QTP to convert Actions into Business Process Components.

49) What is the extension for a function library?

The extension is  '.QFL'

50) If the Global Data sheet contains no data and the Local Datasheet contains two rows of data, how many times will the test iterate?

The test will iterate only once - global iteration.

63) What are the types of Automation Framework in UFT?

In order to ease the process of test automation using UFT, test automation is designed.  There are mainly three types of automation 
frameworks in UFT

Keyword Driven Framework: It is used when multiple functionality needs to be tested.
Data Driven Framework: It is used to test same flow with different test data, test data is given more importance than multiple 
functionality of application
Hybrid Framework: It is a combination of data driven framework and keyword.
64) When we should use descriptive programming in UFT?
Either through object repository or description programming, UFT identifies objects.  Descriptive programming is used in following 
scenarios

a)      It is used to remove duplicate objects.  Same objects exists in different screens or windows of your application.  If you 
use OR in this case you have to store same object under different object hierarchy in OR.  To deal with such situation, descriptive 
programming is used

b)      It is not appropriate in certain scenarios to store the objects inside OR (Object Repository).  Suppose if you want to print 
100 links on the page, you should not store all links in OR. Instead you should use Description Programming to access those links.

65) What is "settoproperty" and when to use it in UFT?

Settoproperty stands for set test object property.  You can use this property to change the object values at runtime.  You can edit 
the property values during the runtime, but the changes that are made are temporary.

it is possible by using AND function.

Example: If you have two cells, A1 and A2, and the value you put in those two cells are >5 and you want result should display as 'TRUE' in cell B1 if 
value>5, and 'False' if any of those values<5. You can use AND function to do that.

41) How cell reference is useful in the calculation?

In order to avoid writing the data again and again for calculating purpose, cell reference is used. When you write any formula, for specific function, 
you need to direct Excel the specific location of that data. This location is referred as, cell reference. So, every time a new value added to the cell, 
the cell will calculate according to the reference cell formula.

1. What is DBMS?

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a program that controls creation, maintenance and use of a database. DBMS can be termed as File
 Manager that manages data in a database rather than saving it in file systems.

2. What is RDBMS?

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS store the data into the collection of tables, which is related by common 
fields between the columns of the table. It also provides relational operators to manipulate the data stored into the tables.

Example: SQL Server.

3. What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language , and it is used to communicate with the Database. This is a standard language used to perform 
tasks such as retrieval, updation, insertion and deletion of data from a database.

Standard SQL Commands are Select.

4. What is a Database?

Database is nothing but an organized form of data for easy access, storing, retrieval and managing of data. This is also known as structured
 form of data which can be accessed in many ways.

Example: School Management Database, Bank Management Database.

5. What are tables and Fields?

A table is a set of data that are organized in a model with Columns and Rows. Columns can be categorized as vertical, and Rows are horizontal.
 A table has specified number of column called fields but can have any number of rows which is called record.

Example:.

Table: Employee.

Field: Emp ID, Emp Name, Date of Birth.

Data: 201456, David, 11/15/1960.

6. What is a primary key?

A primary key is a combination of fields which uniquely specify a row. This is a special kind of unique key, and it has implicit NOT NULL 
constraint. It means, Primary key values cannot be NULL.

7. What is a unique key?

A Unique key constraint uniquely identified each record in the database. This provides uniqueness for the column or set of columns.

A Primary key constraint has automatic unique constraint defined on it. But not, in the case of Unique Key.

There can be many unique constraint defined per table, but only one Primary key constraint defined per table.

8. What is a foreign key?

A foreign key is one table which can be related to the primary key of another table. Relationship needs to be created between two tables
 by referencing foreign key with the primary key of another table.

9. What is a join?

This is a keyword used to query data from more tables based on the relationship between the fields of the tables. Keys play a major role 
when JOINs are used.

10. What are the types of join and explain each?

There are various types of join which can be used to retrieve data and it depends on the relationship between tables.

Inner Join.
Inner join return rows when there is at least one match of rows between the tables.

Right Join.
Right join return rows which are common between the tables and all rows of Right hand side table. Simply, it returns all the rows from 
the right hand side table even though there are no matches in the left hand side table.

Left Join.
Left join return rows which are common between the tables and all rows of Left hand side table. Simply, it returns all the rows from Left
 hand side table even though there are no matches in the Right hand side table.

Full Join.
Full join return rows when there are matching rows in any one of the tables. This means, it returns all the rows from the left hand side 
table and all the rows from the right hand side table.

11. What is normalization?

Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy and dependency by organizing fields and table of a database. The main aim of Normalization
 is to add, delete or modify field that can be made in a single table.

12. What is Denormalization.

DeNormalization is a technique used to access the data from higher to lower normal forms of database. It is also process of introducing 
redundancy into a table by incorporating data from the related tables.

13. What are all the different normalizations?

The normal forms can be divided into 5 forms, and they are explained below -.

First Normal Form (1NF):.
This should remove all the duplicate columns from the table. Creation of tables for the related data and identification of unique columns.

Second Normal Form (2NF):.
Meeting all requirements of the first normal form. Placing the subsets of data in separate tables and Creation of relationships between the tables
 using primary keys.

Third Normal Form (3NF):.
This should meet all requirements of 2NF. Removing the columns which are not dependent on primary key constraints.

Fourth Normal Form (4NF):.
Meeting all the requirements of third normal form and it should not have multi- valued dependencies.

14. What is a View?

A view is a virtual table which consists of a subset of data contained in a table. Views are not virtually present, and it takes less space to store.
 View can have data of one or more tables combined, and it is depending on the relationship.

15. What is an Index?

An index is performance tuning method of allowing faster retrieval of records from the table. An index creates an entry for each value and it 
will be faster to retrieve data.

16. What are all the different types of indexes?

There are three types of indexes -.

Unique Index.
This indexing does not allow the field to have duplicate values if the column is unique indexed. Unique index can be applied automatically when
 primary key is defined.

Clustered Index.
This type of index reorders the physical order of the table and search based on the key values. Each table can have only one clustered index.

NonClustered Index.
NonClustered Index does not alter the physical order of the table and maintains logical order of data. Each table can have 999 nonclustered indexes.

17. What is a Cursor?

A database Cursor is a control which enables traversal over the rows or records in the table. This can be viewed as a pointer to one row in a set
 of rows. Cursor is very much useful for traversing such as retrieval, addition and removal of database records.

One to One Relationship.
One to Many Relationship.
Many to One Relationship.
Self-Referencing Relationship.

A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is called as main query, and inner query is called subquery. SubQuery is always executed
 first, and the result of subquery is passed on to the main query.

21. What are the types of subquery?

There are two types of subquery - Correlated and Non-Correlated.

A correlated subquery cannot be considered as independent query, but it can refer the column in a table listed in the FROM the list of the main query.

A Non-Correlated sub query can be considered as independent query and the output of subquery are substituted in the main query.

22. What is a stored procedure?

Stored Procedure is a function consists of many SQL statement to access the database system. Several SQL statements are consolidated into a stored 
procedure and execute them whenever and wherever required.

23. What is a trigger?

A DB trigger is a code or programs that automatically execute with response to some event on a table or view in a database. Mainly, trigger helps 
to maintain the integrity of the database.

Example: When a new student is added to the student database, new records should be created in the related tables like Exam, Score and Attendance tables.

24. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands?

DELETE command is used to remove rows from the table, and WHERE clause can be used for conditional set of parameters. Commit and Rollback can be
 performed after delete statement.

TRUNCATE removes all rows from the table. Truncate operation cannot be rolled back.

25. What are local and global variables and their differences?

Local variables are the variables which can be used or exist inside the function. They are not known to the other functions and those variables
 cannot be referred or used. Variables can be created whenever that function is called.

Global variables are the variables which can be used or exist throughout the program. Same variable declared in global cannot be used in functions.
 Global variables cannot be created whenever that function is called.

26. What is a constraint?

Constraint can be used to specify the limit on the data type of table. Constraint can be specified while creating or altering the table statement.
 Sample of constraint are.

NOT NULL.
CHECK.
DEFAULT.
UNIQUE.
PRIMARY KEY.
FOREIGN KEY.
27. What is data Integrity?

Data Integrity defines the accuracy and consistency of data stored in a database. It can also define integrity constraints to enforce business
 rules on the data when it is entered into the application or database.

28. What is Auto Increment?

Auto increment keyword allows the user to create a unique number to be generated when a new record is inserted into the table. AUTO INCREMENT
 keyword can be used in Oracle and IDENTITY keyword can be used in SQL SERVER.

Mostly this keyword can be used whenever PRIMARY KEY is used.

29. What is the difference between Cluster and Non-Cluster Index?

Clustered index is used for easy retrieval of data from the database by altering the way that the records are stored. Database sorts out rows
 by the column which is set to be clustered index.

A nonclustered index does not alter the way it was stored but creates a complete separate object within the table. It point back to the original
 table rows after searching.

30. What is Datawarehouse?

Datawarehouse is a central repository of data from multiple sources of information. Those data are consolidated, transformed and made available
 for the mining and online processing. Warehouse data have a subset of data called Data Marts.

31. What is Self-Join?

Self-join is set to be query used to compare to itself. This is used to compare values in a column with other values in the same column in the 
same table. ALIAS ES can be used for the same table comparison.

32. What is Cross-Join?

Cross join defines as Cartesian product where number of rows in the first table multiplied by number of rows in the second table. If suppose, 
WHERE clause is used in cross join then the query will work like an INNER JOIN.

33. What is user defined functions?

User defined functions are the functions written to use that logic whenever required. It is not necessary to write the same logic several times.
 Instead, function can be called or executed whenever needed.

34. What are all types of user defined functions?

Three types of user defined functions are.

Scalar Functions.
Inline Table valued functions.
Multi statement valued functions.
Scalar returns unit, variant defined the return clause. Other two types return table as a return.

35. What is collation?

Collation is defined as set of rules that determine how character data can be sorted and compared. This can be used to compare A and, other 
language characters and also depends on the width of the characters.

ASCII value can be used to compare these character data.

36. What are all different types of collation sensitivity?

Following are different types of collation sensitivity -.

Case Sensitivity - A and a and B and b.
Accent Sensitivity.
Kana Sensitivity - Japanese Kana characters.
Width Sensitivity - Single byte character and double byte character.
37. Advantages and Disadvantages of Stored Procedure?

Stored procedure can be used as a modular programming - means create once, store and call for several times whenever required. This supports
 faster execution instead of executing multiple queries. This reduces network traffic and provides better security to the data.

Disadvantage is that it can be executed only in the Database and utilizes more memory in the database server.

38. What is Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)?

Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) manages transaction based applications which can be used for data entry, data retrieval and data processing.
 OLTP makes data management simple and efficient. Unlike OLAP systems goal of OLTP systems is serving real-time transactions.

Example - Bank Transactions on a daily basis.

39. What is CLAUSE?

SQL clause is defined to limit the result set by providing condition to the query. This usually filters some rows from the whole set of records.

Example - Query that has WHERE condition

Query that has HAVING condition.

40. What is recursive stored procedure?

A stored procedure which calls by itself until it reaches some boundary condition. This recursive function or procedure helps programmers to use
 the same set of code any number of times.

41. What is Union, minus and Interact commands?

UNION operator is used to combine the results of two tables, and it eliminates duplicate rows from the tables.

MINUS operator is used to return rows from the first query but not from the second query. Matching records of first and second query and other 
rows from the first query will be displayed as a result set.

INTERSECT operator is used to return rows returned by both the queries.

42. What is an ALIAS command?

ALIAS name can be given to a table or column. This alias name can be referred in WHERE clause to identify the table or column.

Example-.

Select st.StudentID, Ex.Result from student st, Exam as Ex where st.studentID = Ex. StudentID
Here, st refers to alias name for student table and Ex refers to alias name for exam table.

43. What is the difference between TRUNCATE and DROP statements?

TRUNCATE removes all the rows from the table, and it cannot be rolled back. DROP command removes a table from the database and operation cannot
 be rolled back.

44. What are aggregate and scalar functions?

Aggregate functions are used to evaluate mathematical calculation and return single values. This can be calculated from the columns in a table.
 Scalar functions return a single value based on the input value.

Example -.

Aggregate - max(), count - Calculated with respect to numeric.

Scalar - UCASE(), NOW() - Calculated with respect to strings.

45. How can you create an empty table from an existing table?

Example will be -.

Select * into studentcopy from student where 1=2
Here, we are copying student table to another table with the same structure with no rows copied.

46. How to fetch common records from two tables?

Common records result set can be achieved by -.

Select studentID from student. <strong>INTERSECT </strong> Select StudentID from Exam
47. How to fetch alternate records from a table?

Records can be fetched for both Odd and Even row numbers -.

To display even numbers-.

Select studentId from (Select rowno, studentId from student) where mod(rowno,2)=0
To display odd numbers-.

Select studentId from (Select rowno, studentId from student) where mod(rowno,2)=1
from (Select rowno, studentId from student) where mod(rowno,2)=1.[/sql]

48. How to select unique records from a table?

Select unique records from a table by using DISTINCT keyword.

Select DISTINCT StudentID, StudentName from Student.
49. What is the command used to fetch first 5 characters of the string?

There are many ways to fetch first 5 characters of the string -.

Select SUBSTRING(StudentName,1,5) as studentname from student
Select LEFT(Studentname,5) as studentname from student
50. Which operator is used in query for pattern matching?

LIKE operator is used for pattern matching, and it can be used as -.

% - Matches zero or more characters.
_(Underscore) - Matching exactly one character.
Example -.

Select * from Student where studentname like 'a%'
Select * from Student where studentname like 'ami_'
 


<b id="GN__plsql_interview_questions:">GN__plsql_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>  

1) What is PL SQL ?

PL SQL is a procedural language which has interactive SQL, as well as procedural programming language constructs like conditional 
branching and iteration.

2) Differentiate between % ROWTYPE and TYPE RECORD.

% ROWTYPE is used when a query returns an entire row of a table or view.

TYPE RECORD, on the other hand, is used when a query returns column of different tables or views.

Eg. TYPE r_emp is RECORD (sno smp.smpno%type,sname smp sname %type)

e_rec smp %ROWTYPE

Cursor c1 is select smpno,dept from smp;

e_rec c1 %ROWTYPE

3) Explain uses of cursor.

Cursor is a named private area in SQL from which information can be accessed. They are required to process each row individually 
for queries which return multiple rows.

4) Show code of a cursor for loop.

Cursor declares %ROWTYPE as loop index implicitly. It then opens a cursor, gets rows of values from the active set in fields of the 
record and shuts when all records are processed.

Eg. FOR smp_rec IN C1 LOOP

totalsal=totalsal+smp_recsal;

ENDLOOP;

5) Explain the uses of database trigger.

A PL/SQL program unit associated with a particular database table is called a database trigger. It is used for :

1) Audit data modifications.

2) Log events transparently.

3) Enforce complex business rules.

4) Maintain replica tables

5) Derive column values

6) Implement Complex security authorizations

6) What are the two types of exceptions.

Error handling part of PL/SQL block is called Exception. They have two types : user_defined and predefined.

7) Show some predefined exceptions.

DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX

ZERO_DIVIDE

NO_DATA_FOUND

TOO_MANY_ROWS

CURSOR_ALREADY_OPEN

INVALID_NUMBER

INVALID_CURSOR

PROGRAM_ERROR

TIMEOUT _ON_RESOURCE

STORAGE_ERROR

LOGON_DENIED

VALUE_ERROR

etc.

8) Explain Raise_application_error.

It is a procedure of package DBMS_STANDARD that allows issuing of user_defined error messages from database trigger or stored sub-program.

9) Show how functions and procedures are called in a PL SQL block.

Function is called as a part of an expression.

total:=calculate_sal('b644')

Procedure is called as a statement in PL/SQL.

calculate_bonus('b644');

10) Explain two virtual tables available at the time of database trigger execution.

Table columns are referred as THEN.column_name and NOW.column_name.

For INSERT related triggers, NOW.column_name values are available only.

For DELETE related triggers, THEN.column_name values are available only.

For UPDATE related triggers, both Table columns are available.

11) What are the rules to be applied to NULLs whilst doing comparisons?

1) NULL is never TRUE or FALSE

2) NULL cannot be equal or unequal to other values

3) If a value in an expression is NULL, then the expression itself evaluates to NULL except for concatenation operator (||)

12) How is a process of PL SQL compiled?

Compilation process includes syntax check, bind and p-code generation processes.

Syntax checking checks the PL SQL codes for compilation errors. When all errors are corrected, a storage address is assigned to the 
variables that hold data. It is called Binding. P-code is a list of instructions for the PL SQL engine. P-code is stored in the 
database for named blocks and is used the next time it is executed.

13) Differentiate between Syntax and runtime errors.

A syntax error can be easily detected by a PL/SQL compiler. For eg, incorrect spelling.

A runtime error is handled with the help of exception-handling section in an PL/SQL block. For eg, SELECT INTO statement, which does not return any rows.

14) Explain Commit, Rollback and Savepoint.

For a COMMIT statement, the following is true:

Other users can see the data changes made by the transaction.
The locks acquired by the transaction are released.
The work done by the transaction becomes permanent.
A ROLLBACK statement gets issued when the transaction ends, and the following is true.

The work done in a transition is undone as if it was never issued.
All locks acquired by transaction are released.
It undoes all the work done by the user in a transaction. With SAVEPOINT, only part of transaction can be undone.

15) Define Implicit and Explicit Cursors.

A cursor is implicit by default. The user cannot control or process the information in this cursor.

If a query returns multiple rows of data, the program defines an explicit cursor. This allows the application to process each row 
sequentially as the cursor returns it.

16) Explain mutating table error.

It occurs when a trigger tries to update a row that it is currently using. It is fixed by using views or temporary tables, so database
 selects one and updates the other.

17) When is a declare statement required?

DECLARE statement is used by PL SQL anonymous blocks such as with stand alone, non-stored procedures. If it is used, it must come first in a stand alone file.

18) How many triggers can be applied to a table?

A maximum of 12 triggers can be applied to one table.

19) What is the importance of SQLCODE and SQLERRM?

SQLCODE returns the value of the number of error for the last encountered error whereas SQLERRM returns the message for the last error.

20) If a cursor is open, how can we find in a PL SQL Block?

the %ISOPEN cursor status variable can be used.

21) Show the two PL/SQL cursor exceptions.

Cursor_Already_Open

Invaid_cursor

22) What operators deal with NULL?

NVL converts NULL to another specified value.

var:=NVL(var2,'Hi');

IS NULL and IS NOT NULL can be used to check specifically to see whether the value of a variable is NULL or not.

23) Does SQL*Plus also have a PL/SQL Engine?

No, SQL*Plus does not have a PL/SQL Engine embedded in it. Thus, all PL/SQL code is sent directly to database engine. It is much more 
efficient as each statement is not individually stripped off.

24) What packages are available to PL SQL developers?

DBMS_ series of packages, such as, DBMS_PIPE, DBMS_DDL, DBMS_LOCK, DBMS_ALERT, DBMS_OUTPUT, DBMS_JOB, DBMS_UTILITY, DBMS_SQL, DBMS_TRANSACTION, UTL_FILE.

25) Explain 3 basic parts of a trigger.

A triggering statement or event.
A restriction
An action
26) What are character functions?

INITCAP, UPPER, SUBSTR, LOWER and LENGTH are all character functions. Group functions give results based on groups of rows, as opposed 
to individual rows. They are MAX, MIN, AVG, COUNT and SUM.

27) Explain TTITLE and BTITLE.

TTITLE and BTITLE commands that control report headers and footers.

28) Show the cursor attributes of PL/SQL.

%ISOPEN : Checks if the cursor is open or not

%ROWCOUNT : The number of rows that are updated, deleted or fetched.

%FOUND : Checks if the cursor has fetched any row. It is true if rows are fetched

%NOT FOUND : Checks if the cursor has fetched any row. It is True if rows are not fetched.

29) What is an Intersect?

Intersect is the product of two tables and it lists only matching rows.

30) What are sequences?

Sequences are used to generate sequence numbers without an overhead of locking. Its drawback is that the sequence number is lost if 
the transaction is rolled back.

31) How would you reference column values BEFORE and AFTER you have inserted and deleted triggers?

Using the keyword "new.column name", the triggers can reference column values by new collection. By using the keyword "old.column name", 
they can reference column vaues by old collection.

32) What are the uses of SYSDATE and USER keywords?

SYSDATE refers to the current server system date. It is a pseudo column. USER is also a pseudo column but refers to current user logged
 onto the session. They are used to monitor changes happening in the table.

33) How does ROWID help in running a query faster?

ROWID is the logical address of a row, it is not a physical column. It composes of data block number, file number and row number in the 
data block. Thus, I/O time gets minimized retrieving the row, and results in a faster query.

34) What are database links used for?

Database links are created in order to form communication between various databases, or different environments like test, development 
and production. The database links are read-only to access other information as well.

35) What does fetching a cursor do?

Fetching a cursor reads Result Set row by row.

36) What does closing a cursor do?

Closing a cursor clears the private SQL area as well as de-allocates memory

37) Explain the uses of Control File.

It is a binary file. It records the structure of the database. It includes locations of several log files, names and timestamps. They
 can be stored in different locations to help in retrieval of information if one file gets corrupted.

38) Explain Consistency

Consistency shows that data will not be reflected to other users until the data is commit, so that consistency is maintained.

39) Differ between Anonymous blocks and sub-programs.

Anonymous blocks are unnamed blocks that are not stored anywhere whilst sub-programs are compiled and stored in database. They are compiled at runtime.

40) Differ between DECODE and CASE.

DECODE and CASE statements are very similar, but CASE is extended version of DECODE. DECODE does not allow Decision making statements in its place.

select decode(totalsal=12000,'high',10000,'medium') as decode_tesr from smp where smpno in (10,12,14,16);

This statement returns an error.

CASE is directly used in PL SQL, but DECODE is used in PL SQL through SQL only.

41) Explain autonomous transaction.

An autonomous transaction is an independent transaction of the main or parent transaction. It is not nested if it is started by another transaction.

There are several situations to use autonomous transactions like event logging and auditing.

42) Differentiate between SGA and PGA.

SGA stands for System Global Area whereas PGA stands for Program or Process Global Area. PGA is only allocated 10% RAM size, but SGA is given 40% RAM size.

43) What is the location of Pre_defined_functions.

They are stored in the standard package called "Functions, Procedures and Packages"

44) Explain polymorphism in PL SQL.

Polymorphism is a feature of OOP. It is the ability to create a variable, an object or function with multiple forms. PL/SQL supports 
Polymorphism in the form of program unit overloading inside a member function or package..Unambiguous logic must be avoided whilst overloading is being done.

45) What are the uses of MERGE?

MERGE is used to combine multiple DML statements into one.

Syntax : merge into tablename

using(query)

on(join condition)

when not matched then

[insert/update/delete] command

when matched then

[insert/update/delete] command

46) Can 2 queries be executed simultaneously in a Distributed Database System?

Yes, they can be executed simultaneously. One query is always independent of the second query in a distributed database system based on the 2 phase commit.

47) Explain Raise_application_error.

It is a procedure of the package DBMS_STANDARD that allow issuing a user_defined error messages from the database trigger or stored sub-program.

48) What is out parameter used for eventhough return statement can also be used in pl/sql?

Out parameters allows more than one value in the calling program. Out parameter is not recommended in functions. Procedures can be used 
instead of functions if multiple values are required. Thus, these procedures are used to execute Out parameters.

49) How would you convert date into Julian date format?

We can use the J format string :

SQL > select to_char(to_date('29-Mar-2013','dd-mon-yyyy'),'J') as julian from dual;

JULIAN

50) Explain SPOOL

Spool command can print the output of sql statements in a file.

spool/tmp/sql_outtxt

select smp_name, smp_id from smp where dept='accounts';

spool off;

51) Mention what PL/SQL package consists of?

A PL/SQL package consists of

PL/SQL table and record TYPE statements
Procedures and Functions
Cursors
Variables ( tables, scalars, records, etc.) and constants
Exception names and pragmas for relating an error number with an exception
Cursors
52) Mention what are the benefits of PL/SQL packages?

It provides several benefits like

Enforced Information Hiding: It offers the liberty to choose whether to keep data private or public
Top-down design: You can design the interface to the code hidden in the package before you actually implemented the modules themselves
Object persistence: Objects declared in a package specification behaves like a global data for all PL/SQL objects in the application. 
You can modify the package in one module and then reference those changes to another module
Object oriented design: The package gives developers strong hold over how the modules and data structures inside the package can be used
Guaranteeing transaction integrity: It provides a level of transaction integrity
Performance improvement: The RDBMS automatically tracks the validity of all program objects stored in the database and enhance the performance of packages.
53) Mention what are different methods to trace the PL/SQL code?

Tracing code is a crucial technique to measure the code performance during the runtime. Different methods for tracing includes

DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO
DBMS_TRACE
DBMS_SESSION and DBMS_MONITOR
trcsess and tkproof utilities
54) Mention what does the hierarchical profiler does?

The hierarchical profiler could profile the calls made in PL/SQL, apart from filling the gap between the loopholes and the expectations
 of performance tracing. The efficiencies of the hierarchical profiler includes

Distinct reporting for SQL and PL/SQL time consumption
Reports count of distinct sub-programs calls made in the PL/SQL, and the time spent with each subprogram call
Multiple interactive analytics reports in HTML format by using the command line utility
More effective than conventional profiler and other tracing utilities
55) Mention what does PLV msg allows you to do?

The PLV msg enables you to

Assign individual text message to specified row in the PL/SQL table
It retrieves the message text by number
It substitutes automatically your own messages for standard Oracle error messages with restrict toggle
Batch load message numbers and text from a database table directly PLV msg PL/SQL table
56) Mention what is the PLV (PL/Vision) package offers?

Null substitution value
Set of assertion routines
Miscellaneous utilities
Set of constants used throughout PL vision
Pre-defined datatypes
57) Mention what is the use of PLVprs and PLVprsps?
PLVprs: It is an extension for string parsing for PL/SQL, and it is the lowest level of string parsing functionality
PLVprsps: It is the highest level package to parse PL/SQL source code into separate atomics. It relies on other parsing packages to get work done.
58) Explain how you can copy a file to file content and file to PL/SQL table in advance PL/SQL?

With a single program call - "fcopy procedure", you can copy the complete contents of one file into another file. While to copy the 
contents of a file directly into a PL/SQL table, you can use the program "file2pstab".

59) Explain how exception handling is done in advance PL/SQL?

For exception handling PL/SQl provides an effective plugin PLVexc. PLVexc supports four different exception handling actions.

Continue processing
Record and then continue
Halt processing
Record and then halt processing
For those exceptions that re-occurs you can use the RAISE statement.

60) Mention what problem one might face while writing log information to a data-base table in PL/SQL?

While writing log information to a database table, the problem you face is that the information is only available only once the new rows 
are committed to the database. This might be a problem as such PLVlog is usually deployed to track errors and in many such instances 
the current transaction would fail or otherwise needed a rollback.

61) Mention what is the function that is used to transfer a PL/SQL table log to a database table?

To transfer a PL/SQL table log a database log table function "PROCEDURE ps2db" is used.

62) When you have to use a default "rollback to" savepoint of PLVlog?

The default "rollback to" savepoint of PLVlog is used when the users has turned on the rollback activity and has not provided an alternative
 savepoint in the call to put_line. The default savepoint is initialized to the c none constant.

63) Why PLVtab is considered as the easiest way to access the PL/SQL table?

The PL/SQL table are the closest to arrays in PL/SQL, and in order to access this table you have to first declare a table type, and then
 you have to declare PL/SQL table itself. But by using PLVtab, you can avoid defining your own PL/SQL table type and make PL/SQL data-table access easy.

64) Mention what does PLVtab enables you to do when you showthe contents of PL/SQL tables?

PLVtab enables you to do following things when you show the contents of PL/SQL tables

Display or suppress a header for the table
Display or suppress the row numbers for the table values
Show a prefix before each row of the table
65) Explain how can you save or place your msg in a table?

To save msg in a table, you can do it in two ways

Load individual messages with calls to the add_text procedure
Load sets of messages from a database table with the load_from_dbms procedure
66) Mention what is the use of function "module procedure" in PL/SQL?

The "module procedure" enables to convert all the lines of code in a definite program unit with one procedure call. There are three arguments for modules

module_in
cor_in
Last_module_in
67) Mention what PLVcmt and PLVrb does in PL/SQL?

PL/Vision offers two packages that help you manage transaction processing in PL/SQL application. It is PLVcmt and PLVrb.

PLVcmt: PLVcmt package wraps logic and complexity for dealing with commit processing
PLVrb: It provides a programmatic interface to roll-back activity in PL/SQL






 

<b id="GN__linux_interview_questions:">GN__linux_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

1) What is Linux?

Linux is an operating system based on UNIX and was first introduced by Linus Torvalds. It is based on the Linux Kernel and can run on
 different hardware platforms manufactured by Intel, MIPS, HP, IBM, SPARC, and Motorola. Another popular element in Linux is its mascot,
 a penguin figure named Tux.

2) What is the difference between UNIX and LINUX?

Unix originally began as a propriety operating system from Bell Laboratories, which later on spawned into different commercial versions.
 On the other hand, Linux is free, open source and intended as a non-propriety operating system for the masses.

3) What is BASH?

BASH is short for Bourne Again SHell. It was written by Steve Bourne as a replacement to the original Bourne Shell (represented by /bin/sh).
 It combines all the features from the original version of Bourne Shell, plus additional functions to make it easier and more convenient to
 use. It has since been adapted as the default shell for most systems running Linux.

4) What is Linux Kernel?

The Linux Kernel is a low-level systems software whose main role is to manage hardware resources for the user. It is also used to provide
 an interface for user-level interaction.

5) What is LILO?

LILO is a boot loader for Linux. It is used mainly to load the Linux operating system into main memory so that it can begin its operations.

6) What is a swap space?

Swap space is a certain amount of space used by Linux to temporarily hold some programs that are running concurrently. This happens when RAM
 does not have enough memory to hold all programs that are executing.

7) What is the advantage of open source?

Open source allows you to distribute your software, including source codes freely to anyone who is interested. People would then be able to 
add features and even debug and correct errors that are in the source code. They can even make it run better and then redistribute these enhanced
 source code freely again. This eventually benefits everyone in the community.

8 ) What are the basic components of Linux?

Just like any other typical operating system, Linux has all of these components: kernel, shells and GUIs, system utilities, and an application
 program. What makes Linux advantageous over other operating system is that every aspect comes with additional features and all codes for these
 are downloadable for free.

9) Does it help for a Linux system to have multiple desktop environments installed?

In general, one desktop environment, like KDE or Gnome, is good enough to operate without issues. It's all a matter of preference for the user,
 although the system allows switching from one environment to another. Some programs will work in one environment and not work on the other, so
 it could also be considered a factor in selecting which environment to use.

10) What is the basic difference between BASH and DOS?

The key differences between the BASH and DOS console lie in 3 areas:

- BASH commands are case sensitive while DOS commands are not;

- Under BASH, / character is a directory separator and \ acts as an escape character. Under DOS, / serves as a command argument delimiter and \ 
is the directory separator

- DOS follows a convention in naming files, which is 8 character file name followed by a dot and 3 characters for the extension. BASH follows 
no such convention.

11) What is the importance of the GNU project?

This so-called Free software movement allows several advantages, such as the freedom to run programs for any purpose and freedom to study and 
modify a program to your needs. It also allows you to redistribute copies of software to other people, as well as the freedom to improve 
software and have it released for the public.

12) Describe the root account.

The root account is like a systems administrator account and allows you full control of the system. Here you can create and maintain user accounts,
 assigning different permissions for each account. It is the default account every time you install Linux.

13) What is CLI?

CLI is short for Command Line Interface. This interface allows the user to type declarative commands to instruct the computer to perform operations.
 CLI offers greater flexibility. However, other users who are already accustomed to using GUI find it difficult to remember commands including
 attributes that come with it.

14) What is GUI?

GUI, or Graphical User Interface, make use of images and icons that users click and manipulate as a way of communicating with the computer. 
Instead of having to remember and type commands, the use of graphical elements makes it easier to interact with the system, as well as adding
 more attraction through images, icons, and colors.

15) How do you open a command prompt when issuing a command?

To open the default shell (which is where the command prompt can be found), press Ctrl-Alt-F1. This will provide a command line interface (CLI)
 from which you can run commands as needed.

16) How can you find out how much memory Linux is using?

From a command shell, use the "concatenate" command: cat /proc/meminfo for memory usage information. You should see a line starting something 
like Mem: 64655360, etc. This is the total memory Linux thinks it has available to use.

You can also use commands

free - m

vmstat

top

htop
to find current memory usage

17) What is a typical size for a swap partition under a Linux system?

The preferred size for a swap partition is twice the amount of physical memory available on the system. If this is not possible, then the
 minimum size should be the same as the amount of memory installed.

 18) What are symbolic links?

Symbolic links act similarly to shortcuts in Windows. Such links point to programs, files or directories. It also allows you instant access
 to it without having to go directly to the entire pathname.

19) Does the Ctrl+Alt+Del key combination work on Linux?

Yes, it does. Just like Windows, you can use this key combination to perform a system restart. One difference is that you won't be getting
 any confirmation message and therefore, a reboot is immediate.

20) How do you refer to the parallel port where devices such as printers are connected?

Whereas under Windows you refer to the parallel port as the LPT port, under Linux you refer to it as /dev/lp . LPT1, LPT2 and LPT3 would 
therefore be referred to as /dev/lp0, /dev/lp1, or /dev/lp2 under Linux.

21) Are drives such as hard drive and floppy drives represented with drive letters?

No. In Linux, each drive and device have different designations. For example, floppy drives are referred to as /dev/fd0 and /dev/fd1. IDE/EIDE
 hard drives are referred to as /dev/hda, /dev/hdb, /dev/hdc, and so forth.

22) How do you change permissions under Linux?

Assuming you are the system administrator or the owner of a file or directory, you can grant permission using the chmod command. Use + symbol
 to add permission or - symbol to deny permission, along with any of the following letters: u (user), g (group), o (others), a (all), r (read),
 w (write) and x (execute). For example, the command chmod go+rw FILE1.TXT grants read and write access to the file FILE1.TXT, which is assigned to groups and others.

23) In Linux, what names are assigned to the different serial ports?

Serial ports are identified as /dev/ttyS0 to /dev/ttyS7. These are the equivalent names of COM1 to COM8 in Windows.

24) How do you access partitions under Linux?

Linux assigns numbers at the end of the drive identifier. For example, if the first IDE hard drive had three primary partitions, they would be
 named/numbered, /dev/hda1, /dev/hda2 and /dev/hda3.

25) What are hard links?

Hard links point directly to the physical file on disk, and not on the pathname. This means that if you rename or move the original file, the
 link will not break since the link is for the file itself, not the path where the file is located.

26) What is the maximum length for a filename under Linux?

Any filename can have a maximum of 255 characters. This limit does not include the path name, so therefore the entire pathname and filename could
 well exceed 255 characters.

27)What are filenames that are preceded by a dot?

In general, filenames that are preceded by a dot are hidden files. These files can be configuration files that hold important data or setup
 info. Setting these files as hidden makes it less likely to be accidentally deleted.

28) Explain virtual desktop.

This serves as an alternative to minimizing and maximizing different windows on the current desktop. Using virtual desktops can clear the
 desktop when you can open one or more programs. Rather than minimizing/restoring all those programs as needed, you can simply shuffle
 between virtual desktops with programs intact in each one.

29) How do you share a program across different virtual desktops under Linux?

To share a program across different virtual desktops, in the upper left-hand corner of a program window look for an icon that looks like a
 pushpin. Pressing this button will "pin" that application in place, making it appear in all virtual desktops, in the same position onscreen.

30) What does a nameless (empty) directory represent?

This empty directory name serves as the nameless base of the Linux file system. This serves as an attachment for all other directories,
 files, drives, and devices.

31) What is the pwd command?

The pwd command is short for print working directory command.

Example:

pwd
Output:

/home/guru99/myDir
32) What are daemons?

Daemons are services that provide several functions that may not be available under the base operating system. Its main task is to listen
 for service request and at the same time to act on these requests. After the service is done, it is then disconnected and waits for further requests.

33) How do you switch from one desktop environment to another, such as switching from KDE to Gnome?

Assuming you have these two environments installed, just log out from the graphical interface. Then at the login screen, type your login ID
 and password and choose which session type you wish to load. This choice will remain your default until you change it to something else.

34) What are the kinds of permissions under Linux?

There are 3 kinds of permissions under Linux:- Read: users may read the files or list the directory- Write: users may write to the file of new 
files to the directory- Execute: users may run the file or lookup a specific file within a directory

35) How does case sensitivity affect the way you use commands?

When we talk about case sensitivity, commands are considered identical only if every character is encoded as is, including lowercase and
 uppercase letters. This means that CD, cd, and Cd are three different commands. Entering a command using uppercase letters, where it
 should be in lowercase, will produce different outputs.

36) What are environmental variables?

Environmental variables are global settings that control the shell's function as well as that of other Linux programs. Another common term 
for environmental variables is global shell variables.

37) What are the different modes when using vi editor?

There are 3 modes under vi:- Command mode - this is the mode where you start in- Edit mode - this is the mode that allows you to do text
 editing- Ex mode - this is the mode wherein you interact with vi with instructions to process a file

38) Is it possible to use shortcuts for a long pathname?

Yes, there is. A feature known as filename expansion allows you do this using the TAB key. For example, if you have a path named /home/iceman/assignments
 directory, you would type as follows: /ho[tab]/ice[tab]/assi[tab] . This, however, assumes that the path is unique and that the shell you're using supports this feature.

39) What is redirection?

Redirection is the process of directing data from one output to another. It can also be used to direct an output as an input to another process.

40) What is grep command?

grep a search command that makes use of pattern-based searching. It makes use of options and parameters that are specified along with the command
 line and applies this pattern in searching the required file output.

41) What could be the problem when a command that was issued gave a different result from the last time it was used?

One highly possible reason for getting different results from what seems to be the same command has something to do with case sensitivity issues.
 Since Linux is case sensitive, a command that was previously used might have been entered in a different format from the present one. For example,
 to lists all files in the directory, you should type the command ls, and not LS. Typing LS will either result in an error message if there is no
 program by that exact name exist or may produce a different output if there is a program named LS that performs another function.

42) What are the contents of /usr/local?

It contains locally installed files. This directory matters in environments where files are stored on the network. Specifically, locally-installed
 files go to /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, etc.). Another application of this directory is that it is used for software packages installed from
 source, or software not officially shipped with the distribution.

43) How do you terminate an ongoing process?

Every process in the system is identified by a unique process id or pid. Use the kill command followed by the pid to terminate that process. To
 terminate all process at once, use kill 0.

44) How do you insert comments in the command line prompt?

Comments are created by typing the # symbol before the actual comment text. This tells the shell to completely ignore what follows. For 
example "# This is just a comment that the shell will ignore."

45) What is command grouping and how does it work?

You can use parentheses to group commands. For example, if you want to send the current date and time along with the contents of a file 
named OUTPUT to a second file named MYDATES, you can apply command grouping as follows: (date cat OUTPUT) > MYDATES

46) How do you execute more than one command or program from a single command line entry?

You can combine several commands by separating each command or program using a semicolon symbol. For example, you can issue such a 
series of commands in a single entry:

ls -l cd .. ls -a MYWORK which is equivalent to 3 commands: ls -l cd.. ls -a MYWORK
**Note that this will be executed one after the other, in the order specified.

47) Write a command that will look for files with an extension "c", and has the occurrence of the string "apple" in it.

Answer:

 Find ./ -name "*.c" | xargs grep -i "apple"
48) Write a command that will display all .txt files, including its individual permission.

Answer:

ls -al *.txt
49) Write a command that will do the following:

-look for all files in the current and subsequent directories with an extension c,v
-strip the,v from the result (you can use sed command)
-use the result and use a grep command to search for all occurrences of the word ORANGE in the files.

Find ./ -name "*.c,v" | sed 's/,v//g' | xargs grep "ORANGE"
50) What, if anything, is wrong with each of the following commands?

a) ls -l-s
b) cat file1, file2
c) ls - s Factdir

Answers:
a) there should be space between the 2 options: ls -l -s
b) do not use commas to separate arguments: cat file1 file2
c) there should be no space between hyphen and option label: ls -s Factdir

51) What is the command to calculate the size of a folder?

To calculate the size of a folder uses the command du -sh folder1.

52) How can you find the status of a process?

Use the command

ps ux

53) How can you check the memory status?

You can use the command

free -m to display output in MB

free -g to display output in GB

54) Explain how to color the Git console?

To color the Git console, you can use the command git config - global color.ui auto. In the command, the color.ui variable sets the
 default value for a variable such as color.diff and color.grep.

55) How can you append one file to another in Linux?

To append one file to another in Linux you can use command cat file2 >> file 1. The operator >> appends the output of the named 
file or creates the file if it is not created. While another command cat file 1 file 2 > file 3 appends two or more files to one.

56) Explain how you can find a file using Terminal?

To find a file you have to use a command, find . -name "process.txt" . It will look for the current directory for a file called process.txt.

57) Explain how you can create a folder using Terminal?

To create a folder, you have to use command mkdir. It will be something like these: ~$ mkdir Guru99

58) Explain how you can view the text file using Terminal?

To view the text file, go to the specific folder where the text files are located by using the command cd and then type less filename.txt.

59) Explain how to enable curl on Ubuntu LAMP stack?

To enable curl on Ubuntu, first, install libcurl, once done use following command sudo/etc/init .d /apache2 restart or sudo service apache2 restart.

60) Explain how to enable root logging in Ubuntu?

The command which enables root logging is

#sudo sh-c 'echo "greater-show-manual-login=true" >>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf'

61) How can you run a Linux program in the background simultaneously when you start your Linux Server?

By using nohup. It will stop the process receiving the NOHUP signal and thus terminating it you log out of the program which was
 invoked with. & runs the process in the background.

62) Explain how to uninstall the libraries in Linux?

To uninstall the libraries in Linux, you can use command sudo apt-get remove library_name

1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a client-side as well as server side scripting language that can be inserted into HTML pages and is understood by
 web browsers. JavaScript is also an Object based Programming language

2. Enumerate the differences between Java and JavaScript?

Java is a complete programming language. In contrast, JavaScript is a coded program that can be introduced to HTML pages. These two
 languages are not at all inter-dependent and are designed for the different intent. Java is an object - oriented programming (OOPS)
 or structured programming language like C++ or C whereas JavaScript is a client-side scripting language.

3. What are JavaScript Data Types?

Following are the JavaScript Data types:

Number
String
Boolean
Object
Undefined
4. What is the use of isNaN function?

isNan function returns true if the argument is not a number otherwise it is false.

5. Between JavaScript and an ASP script, which is faster?

JavaScript is faster. JavaScript is a client-side language and thus it does not need the assistance of the web server to execute. On
 the other hand, ASP is a server-side language and hence is always slower than JavaScript. Javascript now is also a server side language (nodejs).

6. What is negative infinity?

Negative Infinity is a number in JavaScript which can be derived by dividing negative number by zero.

7. Is it possible to break JavaScript Code into several lines?

Breaking within a string statement can be done by the use of a backslash, '\', at the end of the first line

Example:

document.write("This is \a program");
And if you change to a new line when not within a string statement, then javaScript ignores break in line.

Example:

var x=1, y=2,
z=
x+y;
The above code is perfectly fine, though not advisable as it hampers debugging.

8. Which company developed JavaScript?

Netscape is the software company who developed JavaScript.

9. What are undeclared and undefined variables?

Undeclared variables are those that do not exist in a program and are not declared. If the program tries to read 
the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered.

Undefined variables are those that are declared in the program but have not been given any value. If the program tries to
 read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.

10. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?

<html> 
<head> 
<title>t1</title> 
<script type="text/javascript"> 
	function addNode() { var newP = document.createElement("p"); 
	var textNode = document.createTextNode(" This is a new text node"); 
	newP.appendChild(textNode); document.getElementById("firstP").appendChild(newP); } 
</script> </head> 
<body> <p id="firstP">firstP<p> </body> 
</html>
11. What are global variables? How are these variable declared and what are the problems associated with using them?

Global variables are those that are available throughout the length of the code, that is, these have no scope. The var
 keyword is used to declare a local variable or object. If the var keyword is omitted, a global variable is declared.

Example:

// Declare a global globalVariable = "Test";

The problems that are faced by using global variables are the clash of variable names of local and global scope. Also,
 it is difficult to debug and test the code that relies on global variables.

12. What is a prompt box?

A prompt box is a box which allows the user to enter input by providing a text box. Label and box will be provided to enter the text or number.

13. What is 'this' keyword in JavaScript?

'This' keyword refers to the object from where it was called.

14. Explain the working of timers in JavaScript? Also elucidate the drawbacks of using the timer, if any?

Timers are used to execute a piece of code at a set time or also to repeat the code in a given interval of time.
 This is done by using the functions setTimeout, setInterval and clearInterval.

The setTimeout(function, delay) function is used to start a timer that calls a particular function after the mentioned delay.
 The setInterval(function, delay) function is used to repeatedly execute the given function in the mentioned delay and only 
 halts when cancelled. The clearInterval(id) function instructs the timer to stop.

Timers are operated within a single thread, and thus events might queue up, waiting to be executed.

15. Which symbol is used for comments in Javascript?

// for Single line comments and

/* Multi

Line

Comment

*/

16. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?

'ViewState' is specific to a page in a session.

'SessionState' is specific to user specific data that can be accessed across all pages in the web application.

17. What is === operator?

=== is called as strict equality operator which returns true when the two operands are having the same value without any type conversion.

18. Explain how can you submit a form using JavaScript?

To submit a form using JavaScript use document.form[0].submit();

document.form[0].submit();
19. Does JavaScript support automatic type conversion?

Yes JavaScript does support automatic type conversion, it is the common way of type conversion used by JavaScript developers

20. How can the style/class of an element be changed?

It can be done in the following way:

document.getElementById("myText").style.fontSize = "20?;
or

document.getElementById("myText").className = "anyclass";
21. Explain how to read and write a file using JavaScript?

There are two ways to read and write a file using JavaScript

Using JavaScript extensions
Using a web page and Active X objects
22. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?

Following are looping structures in Javascript:

For
While
do-while loops
23. What is called Variable typing in Javascript?

Variable typing is used to assign a number to a variable and the same variable can be assigned to a string.

Example

i = 10;
i = "string";
This is called variable typing.

24. How can you convert the string of any base to integer in JavaScript?

The parseInt() function is used to convert numbers between different bases. parseInt() takes the string to be converted 
as its first parameter, and the second parameter is the base of the given string.

In order to convert 4F (of base 16) to integer, the code used will be -

parseInt ("4F", 16);
25. Explain the difference between "==" and "==="?

"==" checks only for equality in value whereas "===" is a stricter equality test and returns false if either the value or
 the type of the two variables are different.

26. What would be the result of 3+2+"7"?

Since 3 and 2 are integers, they will be added numerically. And since 7 is a string, its concatenation will be done. So the result would be 57.

27. Explain how to detect the operating system on the client machine?

In order to detect the operating system on the client machine, the navigator.platform string (property) should be used.

28. What do mean by NULL in Javascript?

The NULL value is used to represent no value or no object. It implies no object or null string, no valid boolean value, no number and no array object.

29. What is the function of delete operator?

The delete keyword is used to delete the property as well as its value.

Example

var student= {age:20, batch:"ABC"};
delete student.age;
30. What is an undefined value in JavaScript?

Undefined value means the

Variable used in the code doesn't exist
Variable is not assigned to any value
Property doesn't exist
31. What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?

Alert
Confirm and
Prompt
32. What is the use of Void(0)?

Void(0) is used to prevent the page from refreshing and parameter "zero" is passed while calling.

Void(0) is used to call another method without refreshing the page.

33. How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?

The following code has to be inserted to achieve the desired effect:

<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" >

<!-- location.href="http://newhost/newpath/newfile.html"; //--></script>
34. What is the data type of variables of in JavaScript?

All variables in the JavaScript are object data types.

35. What is the difference between an alert box and a confirmation box?

An alert box displays only one button which is the OK button.

But a Confirmation box displays two buttons namely OK and cancel.

36. What are escape characters?

Escape characters (Backslash) is used when working with special characters like single quotes, double quotes, apostrophes
 and ampersands. Place backslash before the characters to make it display.

Example:

document.write "I m a "good" boy"
document.write "I m a \"good\" boy"
37. What are JavaScript Cookies?

Cookies are the small test files stored in a computer and it gets created when the user visits the websites to store
 information that they need. Example could be User Name details and shopping cart information from the previous visits.

38. Explain what is pop()method in JavaScript?

The pop() method is similar as the shift() method but the difference is that the Shift method works at the start of the array.
 Also the pop() method take the last element off of the given array and returns it. The array on which is called is then altered.

Example:

var cloths = ["Shirt", "Pant", "TShirt"];
cloths.pop();
//Now cloth becomes Shirt,Pant

39. Whether JavaScript has concept level scope?

No. JavaScript does not have concept level scope. The variable declared inside the function has scope inside the function.

40. Mention what is the disadvantage of using innerHTML in JavaScript?

If you use innerHTML in JavaScript the disadvantage is

Content is replaced everywhere
We cannot use like "appending to innerHTML"
Even if you use +=like "innerHTML = innerHTML + 'html'" still the old content is replaced by html
The entire innerHTML content is re-parsed and build into elements, therefore its much slower
The innerHTML does not provide validation and therefore we can potentially insert valid and broken HTML in the document and break it
41. What is break and continue statements?

Break statement exits from the current loop.

Continue statement continues with next statement of the loop.

42. What are the two basic groups of dataypes in JavaScript?

They are as -

Primitive
Reference types.
Primitive types are number and Boolean data types. Reference types are more complex types like strings and dates.

43. How generic objects can be created?

Generic objects can be created as:

var I = new object();
44. What is the use of type of operator?

'Typeof' is an operator which is used to return a string description of the type of a variable.

45. Which keywords are used to handle exceptions?

Try... Catch---finally is used to handle exceptions in the JavaScript

Try{
	Code
}
Catch(exp){
	Code to throw an exception
}
Finally{
	Code runs either it finishes successfully or after catch
}
46. Which keyword is used to print the text in the screen?

document.write("Welcome") is used to print the text - Welcome in the screen.

47. What is the use of blur function?

Blur function is used to remove the focus from the specified object.

48. What is variable typing?

Variable typing is used to assign a number to a variable and then assign string to the same variable. Example is as follows:

i= 8;
i="john";
49. How to find operating system in the client machine using JavaScript?

The 'Navigator.appversion' is used to find the name of the operating system in the client machine.

50. What are the different types of errors in JavaScript?

There are three types of errors:

Load time errors: Errors which come up when loading a web page like improper syntax errors are known as Load time errors
 and it generates the errors dynamically.
Run time errors: Errors that come due to misuse of the command inside the HTML language.
Logical Errors: These are the errors that occur due to the bad logic performed on a function which is having different operation.
51. What is the use of Push method in JavaScript?

The push method is used to add or append one or more elements to the end of an Array. Using this method, we can append
 multiple elements by passing multiple arguments

52. What is unshift method in JavaScript?

Unshift method is like push method which works at the beginning of the array. This method is used to prepend one
 or more elements to the beginning of the array.

53. What is the difference between JavaScript and Jscript?

Both are almost similar. JavaScript is developed by Netscape and Jscript was developed by Microsoft .

54. How are object properties assigned?

Properties are assigned to objects in the following way -

obj["class"] = 12;
or

obj.class = 12;
55. What is the 'Strict' mode in JavaScript and how can it be enabled?

Strict Mode adds certain compulsions to JavaScript. Under the strict mode, JavaScript shows errors for a piece of
 codes, which did not show an error before, but might be problematic and potentially unsafe. Strict mode also
 solves some mistakes that hamper the JavaScript engines to work efficiently.

Strict mode can be enabled by adding the string literal "use strict" above the file. This can be illustrated by the given example:

function myfunction() {
    "use strict";
    var v = "This is a strict mode function";
}
56. What is the way to get the status of a CheckBox?

The status can be acquired as follows -

alert(document.getElementById('checkbox1').checked);

If the CheckBox will be checked, this alert will return TRUE.

57. How can the OS of the client machine be detected?

The navigator.appVersion string can be used to detect the operating system on the client machine.

58. Explain window.onload and onDocumentReady?

The onload function is not run until all the information on the page is loaded. This leads to a substantial delay before any code is executed.

onDocumentReady loads the code just after the DOM is loaded. This allows early manipulation of the code.

59. How will you explain closures in JavaScript? When are they used?

Closure is a locally declared variable related to a function which stays in memory when the function has returned.

For example:

function greet(message) {

    console.log(message);

}

function greeter(name, age) {

    return name + " says howdy!! He is " + age + " years old";

}

// Generate the message

var message = greeter("James", 23);

// Pass it explicitly to greet

greet(message);

This function can be better represented by using closures

function greeter(name, age) {

    var message = name + " says howdy!! He is " + age + " years old";

    return function greet() {

        console.log(message);

    };

}

// Generate the closure

var JamesGreeter = greeter("James", 23);

// Use the closure

JamesGreeter();
60. How can a value be appended to an array?

A value can be appended to an array in the given manner -

arr[arr.length] = value;

61. Explain the for-in loop?

The for-in loop is used to loop through the properties of an object.

The syntax for the for-in loop is -

for (variable name in object){
	statement or block to execute
}
In each repetition, one property from the object is associated to the variable name, and the loop is continued
 till all the properties of the object are depleted.

62. Describe the properties of an anonymous function in JavaScript?

A function that is declared without any named identifier is known as an anonymous function. In general,
 an anonymous function is inaccessible after its declaration.

Anonymous function declaration -

var anon = function() {
	alert('I am anonymous');
};
anon();
63. What is the difference between .call() and .apply()?

The function .call() and .apply() are very similar in their usage except a little difference. .call() is used when
 the number of the function's arguments are known to the programmer, as they have to be mentioned as arguments in 
 the call statement. On the other hand, .apply() is used when the number is not known. The function .apply() expects
 the argument to be an array.

The basic difference between .call() and .apply() is in the way arguments are passed to the function.
 Their usage can be illustrated by the given example.

var someObject = {
myProperty : 'Foo',

myMethod : function(prefix, postfix) {

	alert(prefix + this.myProperty + postfix);
}
};
someObject.myMethod('<', '>'); // alerts '<Foo>'
var someOtherObject  = {

	myProperty : 'Bar'

};
someObject.myMethod.call(someOtherObject, '<', '>'); // alerts '<Bar>'

someObject.myMethod.apply(someOtherObject, ['<', '>']); // alerts '<Bar>'
64. Define event bubbling?

JavaScript allows DOM elements to be nested inside each other. In such a case, if the handler of the child is clicked,
 the handler of parent will also work as if it were clicked too.

65. Is JavaScript case sensitive? Give an example?

Yes, JavaScript is case sensitive. For example, a function parseInt is not same as the function Parseint.

66. What boolean operators can be used in JavaScript?

The 'And' Operator (&&), 'Or' Operator (||) and the 'Not' Operator (!) can be used in JavaScript.

*Operators are without the parenthesis.

67. How can a particular frame be targeted, from a hyperlink, in JavaScript?

This can be done by including the name of the required frame in the hyperlink using the 'target' attribute.

<a href="/newpage.htm" target="newframe">>New Page</a>
68. What is the role of break and continue statements?

Break statement is used to come out of the current loop while the continue statement continues the current loop with a new recurrence.

69. Write the point of difference between web-garden and a web-farm?

Both web-garden and web-farm are web hosting systems. The only difference is that web-garden is a setup that includes
 many processors in a single server while web-farm is a larger setup that uses more than one server.

70. How are object properties assigned?

Assigning properties to objects is done in the same way as a value is assigned to a variable. For example,
 a form object's action value is assigned as 'submit' in the following manner - Document.form.action="submit"

71. What is the method for reading and writing a file in JavaScript?

This can be done by Using JavaScript extensions (runs from JavaScript Editor), example for opening of a file -

fh = fopen(getScriptPath(), 0);
72. How are DOM utilized in JavaScript?

DOM stands for Document Object Model and is responsible for how various objects in a document interact with each other.
 DOM is required for developing web pages, which includes objects like paragraph, links, etc. These objects can be operated 
 to include actions like add or delete. DOM is also required to add extra capabilities to a web page. On top of that,
 the use of API gives an advantage over other existing models.

73. How are event handlers utilized in JavaScript?

Events are the actions that result from activities, such as clicking a link or filling a form, by the user. An event handler is 
required to manage proper execution of all these events. Event handlers are an extra attribute of the object. 
This attribute includes event's name and the action taken if the event takes place.

74. Explain the role of deferred scripts in JavaScript?

By default, the parsing of the HTML code, during page loading, is paused until the script has not stopped executing. 
It means, if the server is slow or the script is particularly heavy, then the webpage is displayed with a delay. 
While using Deferred, scripts delays execution of the script till the time HTML parser is running. 
This reduces the loading time of web pages and they get displayed faster.

75. What are the various functional components in JavaScript?

The different functional components in JavaScript are-

First-class functions: Functions in JavaScript are utilized as first class objects. This usually means that these functions
 can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, assigned to variables or can
 also be stored in data structures.

Nested functions: The functions, which are defined inside other functions, are called Nested functions. 
They are called 'everytime' the main function is invoked.

76. Write about the errors shown in JavaScript?

JavaScript gives a message if it encounters an error. The recognized errors are -

Load-time errors: The errors shown at the time of the page loading are counted under Load-time errors. These errors are
 encountered by the use of improper syntax, and thus are detected while the page is getting loaded.
Run-time errors: This is the error that comes up while the program is running. It is caused by illegal operations,
 for example, division of a number by zero, or trying to access a non-existent area of the memory.
Logic errors: It is caused by the use of syntactically correct code, which does not fulfill the required task. For example, an infinite loop.
77. What are Screen objects?

Screen objects are used to read the information from the client's screen. The properties of screen objects are -

AvailHeight: Gives the height of client's screen
AvailWidth: Gives the width of client's screen.
ColorDepth: Gives the bit depth of images on the client's screen
Height: Gives the total height of the client's screen, including the taskbar
Width: Gives the total width of the client's screen, including the taskbar
78. Explain the unshift() method ?

This method is functional at the starting of the array, unlike the push(). It adds the desired number of elements 
to the top of an array. For example -

var name = [ "john" ];
name.unshift( "charlie" );
name.unshift( "joseph", "Jane" );
console.log(name);
The output is shown below:

[" joseph "," Jane ", " charlie ", " john "]
79. Define unescape() and escape() functions?

The escape () function is responsible for coding a string so as to make the transfer of the information from one computer to the other, across a network.

For Example:

<script>
	document.write(escape("Hello? How are you!"));
</script>
Output: Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21

The unescape() function is very important as it decodes the coded string.

It works in the following way. For example:

<script>
	document.write(unescape("Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21"));
</script>
Output: Hello? How are you!

80. What are the decodeURI() and encodeURI()?

EncodeURl() is used to convert URL into their hex coding. And DecodeURI() is used to convert the encoded URL back to normal.

<script>
	var uri="my test.asp?name=ståle&car=saab";

	document.write(encodeURI(uri)+ "<br>");

	document.write(decodeURI(uri));
</script>
Output -

my%20test.asp?name=st%C3%A5le&car=saab

my test.asp?name=ståle&car=saab

81. Why it is not advised to use innerHTML in JavaScript?

innerHTML content is refreshed every time and thus is slower. There is no scope for validation in innerHTML and, 
therefore, it is easier to insert rouge code in the document and, thus, make the web page unstable.

82. What does the following statement declares?

var myArray = [[[]]];
It declares a three dimensional array.

83. How are JavaScript and ECMA Script related?

ECMA Script are like rules and guideline while Javascript is a scripting language used for web development.

84. What is namespacing in JavaScript and how is it used?

Namespacing is used for grouping the desired functions, variables etc. under a unique name. It is a name that has 
been attached to the desired functions, objects and properties. This improves modularity in the coding and enables code reuse.




<b id="GN__c#_interview_questions:">GN__c#_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a> 

1. What is C#?

C# is an object-oriented, type-safe, and managed language that is compiled by .Net framework to generate Microsoft Intermediate Language.

2. Explain types of comment in C# with examples

Single line

Example:

//This is a single line comment
ii. Multiple line (/* */)

Example:

/*This is a multiple line comment
We are in line 2
Last line of comment*/
iii. XML Comments (///).

Eg:

/// summary;
/// Set error message for multilingual language.
/// summary
3. Can multiple catch blocks be executed?

No, Multiple catch blocks can't be executed. Once the proper catch code executed, the control is transferred to the finally block,
 and then the code that follows the finally block gets executed.

4. What is the difference between public, static, and void?

Public declared variables or methods are accessible anywhere in the application. Static declared variables or methods are globally 
accessible without creating an instance of the class. Static member are by default not globally accessible it depends upon the type of 
access modified used. The compiler stores the address of the method as the entry point and uses this information to begin execution before
 any objects are created. And Void is a type modifier that states that the method or variable does not return any value.

5. What is an object?

An object is an instance of a class through which we access the methods of that class. "New" keyword is used to create an object. 
A class that creates an object in memory will contain the information about the methods, variables, and behavior of that class.

6. Define Constructors

A constructor is a member function in a class that has the same name as its class. The constructor is automatically invoked 
whenever an object class is created. It constructs the values of data members while initializing the class.

7. What is Jagged Arrays?
The Array which has elements of type array is called jagged Array. The elements can be of different dimensions and sizes. 
We can also call jagged Array as an Array of arrays.

8. What is the difference between ref & out parameters?

An argument passed as ref must be initialized before passing to the method whereas out parameter needs not to be initialized before passing to a method.

9. What is the use of 'using' statement in C#?

The 'using' block is used to obtain a resource and process it and then automatically dispose of when the execution of the block completed.

10. What is serialization?

When we want to transport an object through a network, then we have to convert the object into a stream of bytes. 
The process of converting an object into a stream of bytes is called Serialization. For an object to be serializable, 
it should implement ISerialize Interface. De-serialization is the reverse process of creating an object from a stream of bytes.

11. Can we use "this" command within a static method?

We can't use 'This' in a static method because we can only use static variables/methods in a static method.

12. What is the difference between constants and read-only?

Constant variables are declared and initialized at compile time. The value can't be changed afterward. Read-only is used only when we want to assign the value at run time.

13. What is an interface class? Give one example of it

An Interface is an abstract class which has only public abstract methods, and the methods only have the declaration 
and not the definition. These abstract methods must be implemented in the inherited classes.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
namespace DemoApplication
{
 interface Guru99Interface
 {
  void SetTutorial(int pID, string pName);
  String GetTutorial();
 }

 class Guru99Tutorial : Guru99Interface
 {
  protected int TutorialID;
  protected string TutorialName;

  public void SetTutorial(int pID, string pName)
  {
   TutorialID = pID;
   TutorialName = pName;
  }

  public String GetTutorial()
  {
   return TutorialName;
  }

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
   Guru99Tutorial pTutor = new Guru99Tutorial();

   pTutor.SetTutorial(1,".Net by Guru99");

   Console.WriteLine(pTutor.GetTutorial());

   Console.ReadKey();
  }
 }
}
14. What are value types and reference types?

A value type holds a data value within its own memory space. Example

int a = 30;
Reference type stores the address of the Object where the value is being stored. It is a pointer to another memory location.

string b = "Hello Guru99!!";
15. What are Custom Control and User Control?

Custom Controls are controls generated as compiled code (Dlls), those are easier to use and can be added to toolbox. 
Developers can drag and drop controls to their web forms. Attributes can, at design time. We can easily add custom controls
 to Multiple Applications (If Shared Dlls). So, If they are private, then we can copy to dll to bin directory of web 
 application and then add reference and can use them.

User Controls are very much similar to ASP include files, and are easy to create. User controls can't be placed in the 
toolbox and dragged - dropped from it. They have their design and code-behind. The file extension for user controls is ascx.

16. What are sealed classes in C#?

We create sealed classes when we want to restrict the class to be inherited. Sealed modifier used to prevent derivation 
from a class. If we forcefully specify a sealed class as base class, then a compile-time error occurs.

17. What is method overloading?

Method overloading is creating multiple methods with the same name with unique signatures in the same class. When we compile, 
the compiler uses overload resolution to determine the specific method to be invoke.

18. What is the difference between Array and Arraylist?

In an array, we can have items of the same type only. The size of the array is fixed when compared. To an arraylist is similar 
to an array, but it doesn't have a fixed size.

19. Can a private virtual method can be overridden?

No, because they are not accessible outside the class.

20. Describe the accessibility modifier "protected internal".

Protected Internal variables/methods are accessible within the same assembly and also from the classes that are derived from this parent class.

21. What are the differences between System.String and System.Text.StringBuilder classes?

System.String is immutable. When we modify the value of a string variable, then a new memory is allocated to the new value and 
the previous memory allocation released. System.StringBuilder was designed to have a concept of a mutable string where a variety of 
operations can be performed without allocation separate memory location for the modified string.

22. What's the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone() ?

Using Clone() method, we creates a new array object containing all the elements in the original Array and using CopyTo() method. All 
the elements of existing array copies into another existing array. Both methods perform a shallow copy.

23. How can we sort the elements of the Array in descending order?

Using Sort() methods followed by Reverse() method.

24. Write down the C# syntax to catch an exception

To catch an exception, we use try-catch blocks. Catch block can have a parameter of system.Exception type.

Eg:
try {
    GetAllData();
} 
catch (Exception ex) {
}
In the above example, we can omit the parameter from catch statement.

25. What's the difference between an interface and abstract class?

Interfaces have all the methods having only declaration but no definition. In an abstract class, we can have some concrete methods.
 In an interface class, all the methods are public. An abstract class may have private methods.

26. What is the difference between Finalize() and Dispose() methods?

Dispose() is called when we want for an object to release any unmanaged resources with them. On the other hand, Finalize() is used 
for the same purpose, but it doesn't assure the garbage collection of an object.

27. What are circular references?

Circular reference is situation in which two or more resources are interdependent on each other causes the lock condition and make 
the resources unusable.

28. What are generics in C#.NET?

Generics are used to make reusable code classes to decrease the code redundancy, increase type safety, and performance. Using generics, 
we can create collection classes. To create generic collection, System.Collections.Generic namespace should be used instead of classes 
such as ArrayList in the System.Collections namespace. Generics promotes the usage of parameterized types.

29. What is an object pool in .NET?

An object pool is a container having objects ready to be used. It tracks the object that is currently in use, total number of objects 
in the pool. This reduces the overhead of creating and re-creating objects.

30. List down the commonly used types of exceptions in .net

ArgumentException, ArgumentNullException , ArgumentOutOfRangeException, ArithmeticException, DivideByZeroException ,OverflowException , 
IndexOutOfRangeException ,InvalidCastException ,InvalidOperationException , IOEndOfStreamException , NullReferenceException , 
OutOfMemoryException , StackOverflowException etc.

31. What are Custom Exceptions?

Sometimes there are some errors that need to be handled as per user requirements. Custom exceptions are used for them and are used defined exceptions.

32. What are delegates?

Delegates are same are function pointers in C++, but the only difference is that they are type safe, unlike function pointers. 
Delegates are required because they can be used to write much more generic type-safe functions.

33. How do you inherit a class into other class in C#?

Colon is used as inheritance operator in C#. Just place a colon and then the class name.

public class DerivedClass : BaseClass

34. What is the base class in .net from which all the classes are derived from?

System.Object
35. What is the difference between method overriding and method overloading?

In method overriding, we change the method definition in the derived class that changes the method behavior. Method overloading is 
creating a method with the same name within the same class having different signatures.

36. What are the different ways a method can be overloaded?

Methods can be overloaded using different data types for a parameter, different order of parameters, and different number of parameters.

37. Why can't you specify the accessibility modifier for methods inside the interface?

In an interface, we have virtual methods that do not have method definition. All the methods are there to be overridden in the derived class. 
That's why they all are public.

38. How can we set the class to be inherited, but prevent the method from being over-ridden?

Declare the class as public and make the method sealed to prevent it from being overridden.

39. What happens if the inherited interfaces have conflicting method names?

Implement is up to you as the method is inside your own class. There might be a problem when the methods from different interfaces 
expect different data, but as far as compiler cares you're okay.

40. What is the difference between a Struct and a Class?

Structs are value-type variables, and classes are reference types. Structs stored on the Stack causes additional overhead but 
faster retrieval. Structs cannot be inherited.

41. How to use nullable types in .Net?

Value types can take either their normal values or a null value. Such types are called nullable types.

Int? someID = null;
If(someID.HasVAlue)
{
}
42. How we can create an array with non-default values?

We can create an array with non-default values using Enumerable.Repeat.

43. What is difference between "is" and "as" operators in c#?

"is" operator is used to check the compatibility of an object with a given type, and it returns the result as Boolean.

"as" operator is used for casting of an object to a type or a class.

44. What's a multicast delegate?

A delegate having multiple handlers assigned to it is called multicast delegate. Each handler is assigned to a method.

45. What are indexers in C# .NET?

Indexers are known as smart arrays in C#. It allows the instances of a class to be indexed in the same way as an array.

Eg:

public int this[int index]    // Indexer declaration
46. What is difference between the "throw" and "throw ex" in .NET?

"Throw" statement preserves original error stack whereas "throw ex" have the stack trace from their throw point. It is always 
advised to use "throw" because it provides more accurate error information.

47. What are C# attributes and its significance?

C# provides developers a way to define declarative tags on certain entities, eg. Class, method, etc. are called attributes. 
The attribute's information can be retrieved at runtime using Reflection.

48. How to implement a singleton design pattern in C#?

In a singleton pattern, a class can only have one instance and provides an access point to it globally.

Eg:

Public sealed class Singleton
{
Private static readonly Singleton _instance = new Singleton();
}
49. What is the difference between directcast and ctype?

DirectCast is used to convert the type of object that requires the run-time type to be the same as the specified type in DirectCast.

Ctype is used for conversion where the conversion is defined between the expression and the type.

50. Is C# code is managed or unmanaged code?

C# is managed code because Common language runtime can compile C# code to Intermediate language.

51. What is Console application?

A console application is an application that can be run in the command prompt in Windows. For any beginner on .Net, 
building a console application is ideally the first step, to begin with.

52. Give an example of removing an element from the queue

The dequeue method is used to remove an element from the queue.

using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace DemoApplication
{
 class Program
 {
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
   Queue qt = new Queue();
   qt.Enqueue(1);
   qt.Enqueue(2);
   qt.Enqueue(3);

   foreach (Object obj in qt)
   {
    Console.WriteLine(obj);
   }
    Console.WriteLine(); Console.WriteLine();
    Console.WriteLine("The number of elements in the Queue " + qt.Count);
    Console.WriteLine("Does the Queue contain " + qt.Contains(3));
    Console.ReadKey();
   }
 }
}



<b id="GN__asp.net_interview_questions:">GN__asp.net_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

1. What is ASP.Net?

It is a framework developed by Microsoft on which we can develop new generation web sites using web forms(aspx), MVC, HTML, 
Javascript, CSS etc. Its successor of Microsoft Active Server Pages(ASP). Currently there is ASP.NET 4.0, which is used to 
develop web sites. There are various page extensions provided by Microsoft that are being used for web site development. 
Eg: aspx, asmx, ascx, ashx, cs, vb, html, XML etc.

2. What's the use of Response.Output.Write()?

We can write formatted output using Response.Output.Write().

3. In which event of page cycle is the ViewState available?

After the Init() and before the Page_Load().

4. What is the difference between Server.Transfer and Response.Redirect?

In Server.Transfer page processing transfers from one page to the other page without making a round-trip back to the client's browser. 
This provides a faster response with a little less overhead on the server. The clients url history list or current url Server does 
not update in case of Server.Transfer.

Response.Redirect is used to redirect the user's browser to another page or site. It performs trip back to the client where the
 client's browser is redirected to the new page. The user's browser history list is updated to reflect the new address.

5. From which base class all Web Forms are inherited?

Page class.

6. What are the different validators in ASP.NET?

Required field Validator
Range Validator
Compare Validator
Custom Validator
Regular expression Validator
Summary Validator
7. Which validator control you use if you need to make sure the values in two different controls matched?

Compare Validator control.

8. What is ViewState?

ViewState is used to retain the state of server-side objects between page post backs.

9. Where the viewstate is stored after the page postback?

ViewState is stored in a hidden field on the page at client side. ViewState is transported to the client and back to the server, 
and is not stored on the server or any other external source.

10. How long the items in ViewState exists?

They exist for the life of the current page.

11. What are the different Session state management options available in ASP.NET?

In-Process
Out-of-Process.
In-Process stores the session in memory on the web server.

Out-of-Process Session state management stores data in an external server. The external server may be either a SQL Server or a
 State Server. All objects stored in session are required to be serializable for Out-of-Process state management.

12. How you can add an event handler?

Using the Attributes property of server side control.

e.g.

btnSubmit.Attributes.Add("onMouseOver","JavascriptCode();")
13. What is caching?

Caching is a technique used to increase performance by keeping frequently accessed data or files in memory. The request for a 
cached file/data will be accessed from cache instead of actual location of that file.

14. What are the different types of caching?

ASP.NET has 3 kinds of caching :

Output Caching,
Fragment Caching,
Data Caching.
15. Which type if caching will be used if we want to cache the portion of a page instead of whole page?

Fragment Caching: It caches the portion of the page generated by the request. For that, we can create user controls with the below code:

<%@ OutputCache Duration="120" VaryByParam="CategoryID;SelectedID"%>
16. List the events in page life cycle.

1) Page_PreInit
2) Page_Init
3) Page_InitComplete
4) Page_PreLoad
5) Page_Load
6) Page_LoadComplete
7) Page_PreRender
8) Render

17. Can we have a web application running without web.Config file?

Yes

18. Is it possible to create web application with both webforms and mvc?

Yes. We have to include below mvc assembly references in the web forms application to create hybrid application.

System.Web.Mvc

System.Web.Razor

System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations
19. Can we add code files of different languages in App_Code folder?
No. The code files must be in same language to be kept in App_code folder.

20. What is Protected Configuration?

It is a feature used to secure connection string information.

21. Write code to send e-mail from an ASP.NET application?

MailMessage mailMess = new MailMessage ();
mailMess.From = "abc@gmail.com
	";
mailMess.To = "xyz@gmail.com";
mailMess.Subject = "Test email";
mailMess.Body = "Hi This is a test mail.";
SmtpMail.SmtpServer = "localhost";
SmtpMail.Send (mailMess);
MailMessage and SmtpMail are classes defined System.Web.Mail namespace.

22. How can we prevent browser from caching an ASPX page?

We can SetNoStore on HttpCachePolicy object exposed by the Response object's Cache property:

Response.Cache.SetNoStore ();
Response.Write (DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString ());
23. What is the good practice to implement validations in aspx page?

Client-side validation is the best way to validate data of a web page. It reduces the network traffic and saves server resources.

24. What are the event handlers that we can have in Global.asax file?

Application Events: Application_Start , Application_End, Application_AcquireRequestState, Application_AuthenticateRequest, 
Application_AuthorizeRequest, Application_BeginRequest, Application_Disposed, Application_EndRequest, Application_Error, 
Application_PostRequestHandlerExecute, Application_PreRequestHandlerExecute,Application_PreSendRequestContent, 
Application_PreSendRequestHeaders, Application_ReleaseRequestState, Application_ResolveRequestCache, Application_UpdateRequestCache

Session Events: Session_Start,Session_End

25. Which protocol is used to call a Web service?

HTTP Protocol

26. Can we have multiple web config files for an asp.net application?

Yes.

27. What is the difference between web config and machine config?

Web config file is specific to a web application where as machine config is specific to a machine or server. There can be multiple
 web config files into an application where as we can have only one machine config file on a server.

28. Explain role based security ?

Role Based Security used to implement security based on roles assigned to user groups in the organization.

Then we can allow or deny users based on their role in the organization. Windows defines several built-in groups, including
 Administrators, Users, and Guests.

<AUTHORIZATION>< authorization >
< allow roles="Domain_Name\Administrators" / >   < !-- Allow Administrators in domain. -- >
< deny users="*"  / >                            < !-- Deny anyone else. -- >
< /authorization >
29. What is Cross Page Posting?

When we click submit button on a web page, the page post the data to the same page. The technique in which we post the data to 
different pages is called Cross Page posting. This can be achieved by setting POSTBACKURL property of the button that causes the 
postback. Findcontrol method of PreviousPage can be used to get the posted values on the page to which the page has been posted.

30. How can we apply Themes to an asp.net application?

We can specify the theme in web.config file. Below is the code example to apply theme:

<configuration>

<system.web>

<pages theme="Windows7" />

</system.web>

</configuration>
31. What is RedirectPermanent in ASP.Net?

RedirectPermanent Performs a permanent redirection from the requested URL to the specified URL. Once the redirection is done, 
it also returns 301 Moved Permanently responses.

32. What is MVC?

MVC is a framework used to create web applications. The web application base builds on Model-View-Controller pattern which 
separates the application logic from UI, and the input and events from the user will be controlled by the Controller.

33. Explain the working of passport authentication.

First of all it checks passport authentication cookie. If the cookie is not available then the application redirects the user
 to Passport Sign on page. Passport service authenticates the user details on sign on page and if valid then stores the
 authenticated cookie on client machine and then redirect the user to requested page

34. What are the advantages of Passport authentication?

All the websites can be accessed using single login credentials. So no need to remember login credentials for each web site.

Users can maintain his/ her information in a single location.

35. What are the asp.net Security Controls?

<asp:Login>: Provides a standard login capability that allows the users to enter their credentials
<asp:LoginName>: Allows you to display the name of the logged-in user
<asp:LoginStatus>: Displays whether the user is authenticated or not
<asp:LoginView>: Provides various login views depending on the selected template
<asp:PasswordRecovery>: email the users their lost password
36. How do you register JavaScript for webcontrols ?We can register javascript for controls using <CONTROL -name>Attribtues.Add(scriptname,scripttext) method.

37. In which event are the controls fully loaded?

Page load event.

38. what is boxing and unboxing?

Boxing is assigning a value type to reference type variable.

Unboxing is reverse of boxing ie. Assigning reference type variable to value type variable.

39. Differentiate strong typing and weak typing

In strong typing, the data types of variable are checked at compile time. On the other hand, in case of weak typing the 
variable data types are checked at runtime. In case of strong typing, there is no chance of compilation error. 
Scripts use weak typing and hence issues arises at runtime.

40. How we can force all the validation controls to run?

The Page.Validate() method is used to force all the validation controls to run and to perform validation.

41. List all templates of the Repeater control.

ItemTemplate
AlternatingltemTemplate
SeparatorTemplate
HeaderTemplate
FooterTemplate
42. List the major built-in objects in ASP.NET?

Application
Request
Response
Server
Session
Context
Trace
43. What is the appSettings Section in the web.config file?

The appSettings block in web config file sets the user-defined values for the whole application.

For example, in the following code snippet, the specified ConnectionString section is used throughout the project for database connection:

<em><configuration>
<appSettings>
<add key="ConnectionString" value="server=local; pwd=password; database=default" />
</appSettings></em>
44. Which data type does the RangeValidator control support?

The data types supported by the RangeValidator control are Integer, Double, String, Currency, and Date.

45. What is the difference between an HtmlInputCheckBox control and an HtmlInputRadioButton control?

In HtmlInputCheckBoxcontrol, multiple item selection is possible whereas in HtmlInputRadioButton controls,
 we can select only single item from the group of items.

46. Which namespaces are necessary to create a localized application?

System.Globalization

System.Resources

47. What are the different types of cookies in ASP.NET?

Session Cookie - Resides on the client machine for a single session until the user does not log out.

Persistent Cookie - Resides on a user's machine for a period specified for its expiry, such as 10 days, one month, and never.

48. What is the file extension of web service?

Web services have file extension .asmx..

49. What are the components of ADO.NET?

The components of ADO.Net are Dataset, Data Reader, Data Adaptor, Command, connection.

50. What is the difference between ExecuteScalar and ExecuteNonQuery?

ExecuteScalar returns output value where as ExecuteNonQuery does not return any value but the number of rows 
affected by the query. ExecuteScalar used for fetching a single value and ExecuteNonQuery used to execute Insert and Update statements.
