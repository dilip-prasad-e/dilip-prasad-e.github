<b id="Interview Questions:">Interview Questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>
1. Tell me about yourself?
First and most popular question in an interview (not just in Software Testing interview)

Start with your name (if they didn't mention your name before this question), your degree and university (Also 
you could mention your aggregate percentage).

If you are a fresher, tell something about the training's which you have taken up related to the job, also mention 
about your final year project. Mention some of your achievements. Conclude here and ask whether they have any further 
questions which they would like to know about you.

If you are an experienced, start with your position and roles and responsibilities at the current employer and 
go on with other employers (go on in a reverse chronological order). Mention tools (automation tools or defect 
tracking tools or project management tools etc.,) which you have used. Also, mention your achievements and 
conclude here and ask whether they have any further questions which they would like to know about you.

Key Note: Stick to your career, education, and achievements. Interviewer won't show any interest in your family story.

2. What is your Strength?
Mention some strength of yours. Your strengths should sound like it would help the organization in a positive way.

3. What is your Weakness?
Don't ever tell that you don't have any weaknesses. Mention at least one weakness which you had and mention how 
you did overcome it.

4. Why do we hire you?
Tell how successful you are in your current and previous roles and mention your achievements in previous companies 
and how you made your managers happy. Tell your technical skills in detail and tell "I believe I have all the 
qualities you are looking for."

If you are a fresher, you could tell how well you managed to deliver university project on time and made your 
staff happy and tell what you learned about testing and your technical skills.

5. Why did you leave your previous job?
This is to know what kind of situation you decided to move on from the previous job.

Don't answer that the work was no longer interesting or don't blame previous organization or colleagues. Try to 
emphasize your accomplishments and mention you are ready to take new challenges.

6. What are your goals for the future?
List out your goals and segregate them as short-term and long-term goals. While telling about your goals, 
just stick related to your career.

Hope you got some idea based on the above-mentioned Interview Questions.

Answering this questions is very easy if you follow the link. It contains sample answers for both freshers 
and experienced. So, Let's move on to the actual post.

	



<b id="Software Testing Interview Questions:">Software Testing Interview Questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

In this post, we see Software Testing Interview Questions. Our main focus is on Manual Testing Interview Questions. 
Before going ahead, let's see some unavoidable Interview Questions such as Why did you choose Software Testing As Your Career. 
I don't want to take much time of yours but I couldn't move further without mentioning about this inevitable question in any 
interview i.e., Tell Me About Yourself. Click on the link to get some idea on how to answer Tell Me About Yourself. So, 
Let's move on to the actual post.

1. What is Software Testing?

According to ANSI/IEEE 1059 standard - A process of analyzing a software item to detect the differences between existing and 
required conditions (i.e., defects) and to evaluate the features of the software item.

2. What are Quality Assurance and Quality Control?   

Quality Assurance: Quality Assurance involves in process-oriented activities. It ensures the prevention of defects in the 
process used to make Software Application. So the defects don't arise when the Software Application is being developed.

Quality Control: Quality Control involves in product-oriented activities. It executes the program or code to identify the 
defects in the Software Application.

3. What is Verification in software testing?

Verification is the process, to ensure that whether we are building the product right i.e., to verify the requirements 
which we have and to verify whether we are developing the product accordingly or not. Activities involved here are Inspections, 
Reviews, Walk-throughs.

4. What is Validation in software testing?

Validation is the process, whether we are building the right product i.e., to validate the product which we have developed 
is right or not. Activities involved in this is Testing the software application.

5. What is Static Testing?

Static Testing involves in reviewing the documents to identify the defects in the early stages of SDLC.

6. What is Dynamic Testing?

Dynamic testing involves in the execution of code. It validates the output with the expected outcome.

7. What is White Box Testing?

White Box Testing is also called as Glass Box, Clear Box, and Structural Testing. It is based on applications internal code 
structure. In white-box testing, an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills, are used to design test 
cases. This testing usually was done at the unit level.

8. What is Black Box Testing?

Black Box Testing is a software testing method in which testers evaluate the functionality of the software under test without 
looking at the internal code structure. This can be applied to every level of software testing such as Unit, Integration, 
System and Acceptance Testing.

<b id="Software Testing:">Software Testing:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

Software testing is a process, to evaluate the functionality of a software application with an intent to find whether the 
developed software met the specified requirements or not and to identify the defects to ensure that the product is defect free 
in order to produce the quality product.

Let's see standard definition, software testing types such as manual and automation testing, testing methods, testing approaches 
and types of black box testing.

Definition:
According to ANSI/IEEE 1059 standard - A process of analyzing a software item to detect the differences between existing and 
required conditions (i.e., defects) and to evaluate the features of the software item.

Software Testing Types:
Manual Testing: Manual testing is the process of testing the software manually to find the defects. Tester should have the 
perspective of end users and to ensure all the features are working as mentioned in the requirement document. In this process, 
testers execute the test cases and generate the reports manually without using any automation tools.

Automation Testing: Automation testing is the process of testing the software using an automation tool to find the defects. 
In this process, testers execute the test scripts and generate the test results automatically by using automation tools. 
Some of the famous automation testing tools for functional testing are QTP/UFT and Selenium.

Testing Methods:
Static Testing
Dynamic Testing
Static Testing: It is also known as Verification in Software Testing. Verification is a static method of checking documents 
and files. Verification is the process, to ensure that whether we are building the product right i.e., to verify the requirements 
which we have and to verify whether we are developing the product accordingly or not.

Activities involved here are Inspections, Reviews, Walkthroughs

Dynamic Testing: It is also known as Validation in Software Testing. Validation is a dynamic process of testing the real product. 
Validation is the process, whether we are building the right product i.e., to validate the product which we have developed 
is right or not.

Activities involved in this is Testing the software application

Testing Approaches:
White Box Testing
Black Box Testing
Grey Box Testing
White Box Testing: It is also called as Glass Box, Clear Box, Structural Testing. White Box Testing is based on applications 
internal code structure. In white-box testing, an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills, are used 
to design test cases. This testing is usually done at the unit level.

Black Box Testing: It is also called as Behavioral/Specification-Based/Input-Output Testing. Black Box Testing is a software 
testing method in which testers evaluate the functionality of the software under test without looking at the internal code 
structure.

Grey Box Testing: Grey box is the combination of both White Box and Black Box Testing. The tester who works on this type of 
testing needs to have access to design documents. This helps to create better test cases in this process.

Testing Levels:
Unit Testing
Integration Testing
System Testing
Acceptance Testing
Unit Testing: Unit Testing is done to check whether the individual modules of the source code are working properly. i.e. 
testing each and every unit of the application separately by the developer in the developer's environment. It is AKA Module 
Testing or Component Testing

Integration Testing: Integration Testing is the process of testing the connectivity or data transfer between a couple of unit 
tested modules. It is AKA I&T Testing or String Testing. It is subdivided into Top-Down Approach, Bottom-Up Approach and 
Sandwich Approach (Combination of Top Down and Bottom Up).

System Testing (end to end testing): It's a black box testing. Testing the fully integrated application this is also called 
as end to end scenario testing. To ensure that the software works in all intended target systems. Verify thorough testing 
of every input in the application to check for desired outputs. Testing of the users experiences with the application.

Acceptance Testing: To obtain customer sign-off so that software can be delivered and payments received. Types of Acceptance 
Testing are Alpha, Beta & Gamma Testing.

Types of Black Box Testing:
Functionality Testing
Non-functionality Testing
Functional testing: In simple words, what the system actually does is functional testing. To verify that each function of 
the software application behaves as specified in the requirement document. Testing all the functionalities by providing 
appropriate input to verify whether the actual output is matching the expected output or not. It falls within the scope of 
black box testing and the testers need not concern about the source code of the application.

Non-functional testing: In simple words, how well the system performs is non-functionality testing. Non-functional testing 
refers to various aspects of the software such as performance, load, stress, scalability, security, compatibility etc., Main 
focus is to improve the user experience on how fast the system responds to a request.

The Ultimate list of Types of Testing:
Let's see different Types of Software Testing one by one.

1. Functional testing: In simple words, what the system actually does is functional testing. To verify that each function 
of the software application behaves as specified in the requirement document. Testing all the functionalities by providing 
appropriate input to verify whether the actual output is matching the expected output or not. It falls within the scope of 
black box testing and the testers need not concern about the source code of the application.

2. Non-functional testing: In simple words, how well the system performs is non-functionality testing. Non-functional testing 
refers to various aspects of the software such as performance, load, stress, scalability, security, compatibility etc., Main 
focus is to improve the user experience on how fast the system responds to a request.

3. Manual testing: Manual testing is the process of testing the software manually to find the defects. A tester should have 
the perspective of an end user and to ensure all the features are working as mentioned in the requirement document. In this 
process, testers execute the test cases and generate the reports manually without using any automation tools.

4. Automated testing: Automation testing is the process of testing the software using an automation tool to find the defects. 
In this process, executing the test scripts and generating the results are performed automatically by automation tools. Some 
most popular tools to do automation testing are HP QTP/UFT, Selenium WebDriver, etc.,

Manual Testing Vs Automation Testing
Manual Testing:
Manual testing is the process of testing the software manually to find the defects. Tester should have the perspective of an 
end user and to ensure all the features are working as mentioned in the requirement document. In this process, testers execute 
the test cases and generate the reports manually without using any automation tools.

Advantages:
Manual testing can be done on all kinds of applications
It is preferable for short life cycle products
Newly designed test cases should be executed manually
Application must be tested manually before it is automated
It is preferred in the projects where the requirements change frequently and for the products where the GUI changes constantly
It is cheaper in terms of initial investment compared to Automation testing
It requires less time and expense to begin productive manual testing
It allows tester to perform adhoc testing
There is no necessity to the tester to have knowledge on Automation Tools

Disadvantages:
Manual Testing is time-consuming mainly while doing regression testing.
Expensive over automation testing in the long run

Automation Testing:
Automation testing is the process of testing the software using an automation tools to find the defects. In this process, 
executing the test scripts and generating the results are performed automatically by automation tools. Some most popular 
tools to do automation testing are HP QTP/UFT, Selenium WebDriver, etc.,


Advantages:
Automation testing is faster in execution
It is cheaper compared to manual testing in a long run
Automated testing is more reliable
Automated testing is more powerful and versatile
It is mostly used for regression testing
It does not require human intervention. Test scripts can be run unattended
It helps to increase the test coverage

Disadvantages:
It is recommended only for stable products
Automation testing is expensive initially
Most of the automation tools are expensive
It has some limitations such as handling captcha, fonts, color
Huge maintenance in case of repeated changes in the requirements
Not all the tools support all kinds of testing. Such as windows, web, mobility, performance/load testing

5. Black box testing: Black Box Testing is a software testing method in which testers evaluate the functionality of the 
software under test without looking at the internal code structure. This can be applied to every level of software testing 
such as Unit, Integration, System and Acceptance Testing.

6. Glass box testing - Refer white box testing

7. White box testing: White Box Testing is also called as Glass Box, Clear Box, and Structural Testing. It is based on applications 
internal code structure. In white-box testing, an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills, are used to 
design test cases. This testing usually was done at the unit level.

8. Specification-based testing: Refer black-box testing.

9. Structure-based testing: Refer white-box testing.

10. Gray box testing: Grey box is the combination of both White Box and Black Box Testing. The tester who works on this 
type of testing needs to have access to design documents. This helps to create better test cases in this process.

11. Unit testing: Unit Testing is also called Module Testing or Component Testing. It is done to check whether the individual 
unit or module of the source code is working properly. It is done by the developers in the developer's environment.

12. Component testing: Refer Unit Testing

13. Module testing: Refer Unit Testing

14. Integration testing: Integration Testing is the process of testing the interface between the two software units. Integration 
testing is done by multiple approaches such Big Bang Approach, Top-Down Approach, Bottom-Up Approach, and Hybrid Integration approach.

15. System testing: Testing the fully integrated application to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified 
requirements is called System Testing AKA End to End testing. Verifying the completed system to ensure that the application 
works as intended or not.

16. Acceptance testing: It is also known as pre-production testing.  This is done by the end users along with the testers 
to validate the functionality of the application. After successful acceptance testing. Formal testing conducted to determine 
whether an application is developed as per the requirement. It allows the customer to accept or reject the application. Types 
of acceptance testing are Alpha, Beta & Gamma.

17. Big bang Integration Testing: Combining all the modules once and verifying the functionality after completion of 
individual module testing.

Top down and bottom up are carried out by using dummy modules known as Stubs and Drivers. These Stubs and Drivers are used 
to stand-in for missing components to simulate data communication between modules.

18. Top-down Integration Testing: Testing takes place from top to bottom. High-level modules are tested first and then 
low-level modules and finally integrating the low-level modules to a high level to ensure the system is working as intended. 
Stubs are used as a temporary module if a module is not ready for integration testing.

19. Bottom-up Integration Testing: It is a reciprocate of the Top-Down Approach. Testing takes place from bottom to up. 
Lowest level modules are tested first and then high-level modules and finally integrating the high-level modules to a low 
level to ensure the system is working as intended. Drivers are used as a temporary module for integration testing.

20. Hybrid Integration Testing: Hybrid integration testing is the combination of both Top-down and bottom-up integration 
testing.

21. Alpha testing: Alpha testing is done by the in-house developers (who developed the software) and testers. Sometimes 
alpha testing is done by the client or outsourcing team with the presence of developers or testers.

22. Beta testing: Beta testing is done by a limited number of end users before delivery. Usually, it is done in the client 
place.
23. Gamma Testing: Gamma testing is done when the software is ready for release with specified requirements. It is done at 
the client place. It is done directly by skipping all the in-house testing activities.

24. Equivalence partitioning testing: Equivalence Partitioning is also known as Equivalence Class Partitioning. In equivalence 
partitioning, inputs to the software or system are divided into groups that are expected to exhibit similar behavior, so they 
are likely to be proposed in the same way. Hence selecting one input from each group to design the test cases.

25. Boundary value analysis testing: Boundary value analysis (BVA) is based on testing the boundary values of valid and invalid 
partitions. The Behavior at the edge of each equivalence partition is more likely to be incorrect than the behavior within 
the partition, so boundaries are an area where testing is likely to yield defects. Every partition has its maximum and minimum 
values and these maximum and minimum values are the boundary values of a partition. A boundary value for a valid partition is 
a valid boundary value. Similarly, a boundary value for an invalid partition is an invalid boundary value.

26. Decision tables testing: Decision Table is aka Cause-Effect Table. This test technique is appropriate for functionalities 
which has logical relationships between inputs (if-else logic). In Decision table technique, we deal with combinations of inputs. 
To identify the test cases with decision table, we consider conditions and actions. We take conditions as inputs and actions as outputs.

27. Cause-effect graph testing- Refer Decision Table Testing

28. State transition testing: Using state transition testing, we pick test cases from an application where we need to test 
different system transitions. We can apply this when an application gives a different output for the same input, depending 
on what has happened in the earlier state.

29. Exhaustive Testing: Testing all the functionalities using all valid and invalid inputs and preconditions is known as 
Exhaustive testing.

30. Early Testing: Defects detected in early phases of SDLC are less expensive to fix. So conducting early testing reduces 
the cost of fixing defects.

31. Use case testing: Use case testing is carried out with the help of use case document. It is done to identify test 
scenarios to test end to end testing

32. Scenario testing: Scenario testing is a software testing technique which is based on a scenario. It involves in 
converting business requirements to test scenarios for better understanding and achieve end to end testing. A well designed 
scenario should be motivating, credible, complex and the outcome of which is easy to evaluate.

33. Documentation testing: Documentation testing is done to validate the documented artifacts such as requirements, test 
plan, traceability matrix, test cases.

34. Statement coverage testing: Statement coverage testing is a white box testing technique which is to validate whether each 
and every statement in the code is executed at least once.

35. Decision coverage testing/branch coverage testing: Decision coverage or branch coverage testing is a white box testing 
technique which is to validate every possible branch is executed at least once.

36. Path testing: Path coverage testing is a white box testing technique which is to validate that all the paths of the 
program are executed at least once.

37. Mutation testing: Mutation testing is a type of white box testing which is to change (mutate) certain statements in the 
source code and verify if the tests  are able to find the errors.

38. Loop testing: Loop testing is a white box testing technique which is to validate the different kind of loops such as 
simple loops, nested loops, concatenated loops and unstructured loops.

39. Performance testing: This type of testing determines or validates the speed, scalability, and/or stability characteristics 
of the system or application under test. Performance is concerned with achieving response times, throughput, and resource-utilization 
levels that meet the performance objectives for the project or product.

40. Load testing: It is to verify that the system/application can handle the expected number of transactions and to verify 
the system/application behavior under both normal and peak load conditions.

41. Stress testing: It is to verify the behavior of the system once the load increases more than its design expectations.

42. Soak testing: Running a system at high load for a prolonged period of time to identify the performance problems is 
called Soak Testing.

43. Endurance testing: Refer Soak testing

44. Stability testing: Refer Soak testing

45. Scalability Testing: Scalability testing is a type of non-functional testing. It is to determine how the application 
under test scales with increasing workload.

46. Volume testing: It is to verify that the system/application can handle a large amount of data

47. Robustness testing: Robustness testing is a type of testing that is performed to validate the robustness of the 
application.

48. Vulnerability testing: Vulnerability testing is the process of identifying the vulnerabilities or weakness in the 
application.

49. Adhoc testing: Ad-hoc testing is quite opposite to the formal testing. It is an informal testing type. In Adhoc testing, 
testers randomly test the application without following any documents and test design techniques. This testing is primarily 
performed if the knowledge of testers in the application under test is very high. Testers randomly test the application without 
any test cases or any business requirement document.

50. Exploratory testing: Usually, this process will be carried out by domain experts. They perform testing just by exploring 
the functionalities of the application without having the knowledge of the requirements.

51. Retesting: To ensure that the defects which were found and posted in the earlier build were fixed or not in the current build. 
Say, Build 1.0 was released. Test team found some defects (Defect Id 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and posted. Build 1.1 was released, now testing 
the defects 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 in this build is retesting.

52. Regression testing: Repeated testing of an already tested program, after modification, to discover any defects introduced or 
uncovered as a result of the changes in the software being tested or in another related or unrelated software components.

53. Smoke testing: Smoke Testing is done to make sure if the build we received from the development team is testable or not. It is 
also called as "Day 0" check. It is done at the "build level". It helps not to waste the testing time to simply testing the whole 
application when the key features don't work or the key bugs have not been fixed yet.

54. Sanity testing: Sanity Testing is done during the release phase to check for the main functionalities of the application 
without going deeper. It is also called as a subset of Regression testing. It is done at the "release level". At times due to 
release time constraints rigorous regression testing can't be done to the build, sanity testing does that part by checking 
main functionalities.

55. Dynamic testing: Dynamic testing involves in the execution of code. It validates the output with the expected outcome

56. Static testing: Static Testing involves in reviewing the documents to identify the defects in the early stages of SDLC.

57. Monkey testing: Perform abnormal action on the application deliberately in order to verify the stability of the application.

58. Gorilla testing: Gorilla testing is done by testers, sometimes developers also join hands with testers. It involves 
testing a system repeatedly to test the robustness of the system.

59. Usability testing: To verify whether the application is user-friendly or not and was comfortably used by an end user or 
not. The main focus in this testing is to check whether the end user can understand and operate the application easily or not. 
An application should be self-exploratory and must not require training to operate it.

60. Accessibility testing: Accessibility testing is a subset of usability testing. It aims to discover how easily people with 
disabilities (such as visual Impairments, Physical Impairment, Hearing Impairment, Cognitive Impairment, Learning Impairment) 
can use a system.

61. Compatibility testing: It is to deploy and check whether the application is working as expected in a different 
combination of environmental components.

62. Configuration testing: Configuration testing is the process of testing an application with each one of the supported 
hardware and software configurations to find out whether the application can work without any issues.

63. Localization testing: Localization is a process of adapting globalization software for a specific region or language 
by adding local specific components.

64. Globalization testing: Globalization is a process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various 
languages and regions without any changes.

65. Internationalization testing- Refer Globalization testing

66. Positive Testing: It is to determine what system supposed to do. It helps to check whether the application is justifying 
the requirements or not.

67. Negative testing: It is to determine what system not supposed to do. It helps to find the defects from the software.

68. Security testing: Security testing is a process to determine whether the system protects data and maintains functionality 
as intended.

What is Security Testing?
Security testing is a process to determine whether the system protects data and maintains functionality as intended.

Security testing aims to find out all possible loopholes and weaknesses of the system in the starting stage itself to avoid 
inconsistent system performance, unexpected breakdown, loss of information, loss of revenue, loss of customer's trust.

It comes under Non-functional Testing.

We can do security testing using both manual and automated security testing tools and techniques. Security testing reviews 
the existing system to find vulnerabilities.

Most of the companies perform security testing on newly deployed or developed software, hardware, and network or information 
system environment. But it's highly recommended by experts to make security testing as a part of information system audit 
process of an existing information system environment in detecting all possible security risks and help developers in fixing 
them.

Security testing aims at covering following basic security components

Authentication
Authorization
Availability
Confidentiality
Integrity
Non-repudiation
Why Security Testing is Important?
Security testing is important due to the increase in the number of privacy breaches that websites are facing today. In 
order to avoid these privacy breaches, software development organizations have to adopt security testing in their development 
strategy based on testing methodologies and latest industry standards.

It is important to adopt Security Process in each and every phase of SDLC.

Requirement Phase: Security analysis of all the requirements
Design Phase: Implementation of Test Plan including Security tests.
Code & Unit Testing: Security White Box Testing
Integration Testing: Black Box Testing
System Testing: Black Box Testing & Vulnerability Scanning
Implementation of System Testing: Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Scanning
Support: Impact Analysis

Top Vulnerabilities:
Security tests include testing for vulnerabilities such as

SQL Injection
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Session Management
Broken Authentication
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Security Misconfiguration
Failure to Restrict URL Access
Secure Data Exposure
Insecure Direct Object Reference
Missing Function Level Access Control
Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards
Types of Security Testing:
There are seven main types of security testing which are presented below.

Vulnerability Scanning:

In vulnerability scanning (aka vulnerability assessment), we just identify and report the vulnerability using 
vulnerability scanning tools.

It's the first step to improve the security of a system.

A vulnerability assessment report should contain the title, the description and the severity of a vulnerability.

Security Scanning:

Security scanning is done to find weak points in the security of network and system and also provides solutions to 
reduce these risks.

Penetration Testing:

In Penetration testing (aka Pen test), we identify the vulnerabilities and attempt to exploit them using penetration 
testing tools. We repeat the same penetration tests until the system is negative to all those tests.

Pen testing can be divided into three techniques such as manual penetration testing, automated penetration testing and a 
combination of both manual & automated penetration testing.

Risk Assessment:

Risk assessment involves reviewing and analyzing security risks that later will be prioritized as Low, Medium and High. 
It also recommends possible ways to prevent the risk.

Security Auditing:

Security auditing is the procedure of defining security flaws. It is an internal inspection of systems to find security flaws. 
In some cases, an audit is done via line by line inspection of code

Ethical Hacking:

Ethical hacking is done on a system with an intent to find and expose security issues in the system. Ethical hacking is done 
by a white hat hacker. White hat hacker is a security professional who uses their skills in a legitimate manner to reveal 
the defects of a system.

Posture Assessment:

Posture assessment is a combination of security scanning, ethical hacking, and risk assessment to present the security posture 
of a system or organization.
Security Testing Tools:
To find the flaws and vulnerabilities in a web application, there are many free, paid, and open source security testing tools 
available in the market. We know that the advantage of open source tools are we can easily customize it to match our requirements. 
We are here to showcase some of the top __ open source security testing tools.

We use security testing tools for checking how secure a website or web application is.

Open Source Security Testing Tools:

Some of the open source security testing tools are Zed Attack Proxy, Wfuzz, Wapiti etc.,

Commercial Security Testing Tools:

Some of the commercial security testing tools are GrammaTech, Appscan, Veracode etc.,

Conclusion:

We know how important is security testing in current days. It aims to find out all possible loopholes and weaknesses of the system. 
Testers play a role of an attacker to find out security related bugs in the system.

69. Penetration testing: Penetration testing is also known as pen testing. It is a type of security testing. It is performed 
to evaluate the security of the system.

What is a Penetration Testing?
Penetration testing is also a type of Security testing which is performed to evaluate the security of the system (hardware, 
software, networks or an information system environment). The goal of this testing is to find all the security vulnerabilities 
that are present in an application by evaluating the security of the system with malicious techniques and to protect the data 
from the hackers and maintain functionality of the system. It is a type of Non-functional testing which intends to make authorized 
attempts to violate the security of the system. It is also known as Pen Testing or Pen Test and the tester who does this testing 
is a penetration tester aka ethical hacker.

Why is Penetration Testing necessary?
If a system is not secured, then an attacker can take authorized access to the system. Penetration testing evaluates the security 
of a system and protects it against internal and external threats. It identifies the vulnerabilities and determines whether 
unauthorized access or other malicious activity is possible.

Organizations conduct penetration testing for a number of reasons

To prevent data breaches
To check security controls
To meet compliance requirements
To ensure the security of new applications
To access incident detection and response effectiveness
How often to conduct pen testing?
Cyber-attacks are quite often in current days. It is very important to conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing 
to detect recently discovered and previously unknown vulnerabilities.

The frequency of conducting pen testing should depend on your organization's security policy. However, conducting pen testing 
regularly can determine the weaknesses of your system and keep it stay away from security breaches.

Usually, pen testing is done after the deployment of new infrastructure and applications. Also, it is done after major changes 
to infrastructure and applications.

Vulnerability scanning examines the servers for vulnerabilities. We have to make sure the vulnerabilities we found are not false 
positives. Actually reporting false positives is a downside of vulnerability scanning.

Penetration testing examines the servers for vulnerabilities and exploits them.

Both vulnerability scanning and penetration testing can test an organizations ability to detect security breaches. Organizations 
need to scan both the external and internal infrastructure and applications to protect against external and internal threats.

Organizations have to conduct regular penetration testing for the following reasons:

To find security vulnerabilities in a system
To secure user data
To test applications that are often the avenues of attack
To identify new bugs in an existing system after deployment or after major changes done in the system
To prevent the black hat attacks and guards the user data
To control revenue loss
To improve the existing security standards
What are the phases of Penetration Testing?
The process of penetration testing can be divided into five phases, which are as follows:

1. Planning phase

In this phase, we define the scope (which system to test and the goals and objectives to achieve with the penetration test) and 
the resources and the tools (vulnerability scanners or penetration testing tools) to employ for test execution

2. Discovery phase

In this phase, we collect as much information as possible about the systems that are in the scope of the penetration test.

3. Vulnerability assessment:

In vulnerability assessment, we just identify and report the vulnerability using vulnerability scanning tools.

4. Exploitation Phase

In this phase, we try to exploit the vulnerabilities identified in the previous phase (i.e., discovery phase) to gain access to 
the target system.

5. Reporting Phase

In this phase, we document all the results and findings in an effective manner. This report will be used as a reference document 
while mitigating activities to address the identified vulnerabilities.

What are the root causes of Security Vulnerabilities?
Some of the root causes of Security Vulnerabilities are as follows

Complexity:

Security vulnerabilities rise in proportion to the complexity of a system. Complexity in terms of software, hardware, information, 
businesses, and processes introduce more security vulnerabilities.

Connectivity:

Every unsecured connection is a potential avenue for exploitation.

Design Flaws:
There shouldn't be any design bugs in software and hardware. These bugs can expose businesses to significant risks.

Configuration:

Poor system configuration introduces security vulnerabilities.

User Input:

Data received through SQL injections, buffer overflows etc., can be designed to attack the receiving system.

Management:

Management should have a proper risk management plan to avoid security vulnerabilities in the system.

Passwords:

Passwords are there to avoid unauthorized access and secure your personal data. Unsecured passwords (sharing with others, writing 
them down somewhere, setting easy to guess) allows hackers to guess your password easily.

Lack of training:

Lack of training leads to human errors. Human errors can be prevented by giving proper training to the employees.

Human errors:

Human errors such as improper disposal of documents, coding errors, giving out passwords to phishing sites are a significant 
source of security vulnerabilities.

Communication:

Communication channels such as telephone, mobile, internet give scope for security vulnerabilities.

Social:

Employees disclosing sensitive information with outsiders is one of the common reasons for security threats.

What is the difference between Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Scanning?

Before looking into the difference between penetration testing and vulnerability scanning. Let's see two most used terms such as 
vulnerability and exploit.

What is a Vulnerability?

A vulnerability is a security weakness or flaw which can be exploited by an attacker, to perform unauthorized actions within a 
system.

What Is An Exploit?

An exploit is a software program that takes advantage of a vulnerability to cause unintended behavior to occur on a system. 
This action is done to gain control of a system to attack it.

Now let's see the difference between Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.

There is a confusion in the industry on the difference between Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Scanning. Even though these 
two terms are commonly interchanged but there are some differences between these two terms. Penetration testing is not the same 
as the vulnerability testing.

Vulnerability Scanning:

In vulnerability scanning (aka vulnerability assessment), we just identify and report the vulnerability using vulnerability 
scanning tools.

It's the first step to improve the security of a system.

A vulnerability assessment report should contain the title, the description and the severity of a vulnerability.

Penetration Testing:

In Penetration testing (aka Pen test), we identify the vulnerabilities and attempt to exploit them using penetration testing 
tools. We repeat the same penetration tests until the system is negative to all those tests.

A penetration testing report lists the vulnerabilities that were exploited successfully.

If an organization is interested in protecting their system from security issues then they should carry out vulnerability 
assessment and penetration testing on a regular basis.

Pen testing can be divided into three techniques such as manual penetration testing, automated penetration testing and a 
combination of both manual & automated penetration testing.

By using automated penetration testing tools, it is not possible to find all vulnerabilities. Some vulnerabilities can be 
identified using a manual scan. So, experienced pen testers use their experience and skills to attack a system using manual 
penetration testing.

Who Performs Pen-testing?
Pen-testing can be performed by Testers or Network Specialists or Security Consultants.

Role and Responsibilities of Penetration Testers:
Responsibilities of penetration testers vary from company to company. However, there are several core responsibilities common 
to all pen testers such as

Understand complex computer systems and technical cybersecurity terms
Collect the required information from the organization to enable penetration tests
Plan and create penetration methods, scripts, and tests
Carry out onsite testing of clients infrastructure and remote testing of clients network to expose weaknesses in security
Work with clients to determine their requirements from the test
Conducts penetration testing and vulnerability scanning using automated tools, ad-hoc tools, and manual testing
Ability to analyze root causes and deliver strategic recommendations during security reviews
Create reports and recommendations from your findings
Understand how the flaws that you identify could affect business, or business function if they're not fixed.
The flaws that you identify should be reproducible so that it will be easy for developers to fix them
All the data and information should be kept confidential
Types of Penetration Testers?

Black hat penetration testers
White hat penetration testers
Grey hat penetration testers
What is the difference between Black, White and Grey hat hackers?
Black Hat Hackers:

Black hat hackers (aka Black hats) are considered as cybercriminals. They use their skills with an evil motive for personal 
or financial gains. They break into computer networks to destroy data or make the system unusable for those who are authorized 
to use the system. Usually, they involve in hacking banks, stealing credit card information, creating and using a botnet to 
perform DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks etc.,

White Hat Hackers:

White hat hackers (aka White hats) are usually called ethical hackers. Ethical hackers work for good reasons rather than evil. 
Usually, companies recruit these white hat hackers as full-time employees and also some companies work with these white hat 
hackers on contract basis as security specialists to find security loopholes of their system. White hat hackers attack a system 
after getting permission from the owner of the system.

Grey Hat Hackers:

Grey hat hackers (aka Grey hats) may hack a system for ethical and unethical reasons. Activities of these Grey hat hackers fall 
somewhere between black hat hackers and white hat hackers. Grey hat hackers find vulnerabilities in a system. This type of hacking 
is considered illegal because they attack the system without getting permission from the owner of the system. They find for the 
security vulnerabilities but not for bad purposes. After finding security vulnerabilities, they report them to the owner of the 
system. Sometimes they request a fee to fix the issue. If the owner doesn't respond then sometimes the hackers will disclose the 
security flaw to the public.

What are the types of Penetration Tests?
Different types of Pen Testing which are as follows

1. Network Services Tests

Network services pen test aims to identify security weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the network. These tests can be run both 
locally and remotely.

Pen testers should target the following network areas

Firewall config test
Stateful analysis test
Firewall bypass test
IPS deception
DNS level attacks such as Zone transfer testing, Switching or routing issues, and another required network testing
Pen testers also cover some of the most common software packages such as

Secure Shell (SSH)
SQL Server or MySQL
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
2. Web Application Tests

Web application pen tests (web application penetration testing) aim to identify the security vulnerabilities of web applications, 
web browsers, and their components like ActiveX, Applets, Silverlight and APIs.

3. Client Side Tests

Client-side pen tests aim to find security vulnerabilities and exploit them in client-side software applications.

4. Wireless Tests

Wireless pen tests involved in analyzing the Wi-Fi networks and wireless devices deployed on the client site. Wireless devices 
such as laptops, netbooks, tablets, smartphones, iPods etc.,

5. Social Engineering Tests

Employees disclosing sensitive information with outsiders is one of the common reasons of security threats. All the employees 
should follow security standards and policies to avoid social engineering penetration attempt. These tests are mostly done through 
communication channels such as telephone, mobile, internet and it targets employees, helpdesks and processes.

Social engineering pen tests can be subcategorized into two types

Remote Tests:

Remote tests intend to trick an employee to disclose sensitive information via an electronic means (ie., via Phishing Email Campaign)

Physical Tests:

Strong physical security methods should be applied to protect sensitive information. It involves human handling tactics like 
convincing an employee via phone calls. It is generally using in a military facility.

What are the Types of Pen Testing?
There are three types of Pen Testing which can be used, which are as follows

1. Black Box Penetration Testing
2. White Box Penetration Testing
3. Grey Box Penetration Testing

Black Box Penetration Testing

In Black Box Penetration Testing approach, black box pen testers (Black Hat Hackers) assess the target system without having 
any knowledge of system details. They just have high-level details about the system such as URL or company name. They don't 
examine any programming code. These testers are not ethical hackers. It's impossible to gather information about the target system 
from the owner of the system. So they launch an all-out, brute force attack against the system to find out weaknesses or 
vulnerabilities in a system. This approach is also referred as "trial and error" approach.

White Box Penetration Testing

In White Box Penetration Testing approach, white box pen testers (White Hat Hackers) access the target system with complete 
details about the system. Since they have complete details about the system, white box test can be accomplished much quicker 
compared to black box test. White box pen testers are called ethical hackers. This approach is also known as clear box, glass 
box, open box and structural testing.

Grey Box Penetration Testing

In Grey Box Penetration Testing approach, grey box pen testers (Grey Hat Hackers) utilize both manual and automated testing 
processes. It is a combination of both Black Box and White Box penetration testing techniques. These hackers may attack a system 
for ethical and unethical reasons. These hackers find vulnerabilities in a system. This type of hacking is considered illegal 
because they attack the system without getting permission from the owner of the system.

Limitations of Penetration Testing
Penetration testing cannot find all vulnerabilities in a target system. There are some limitations based on the resources and 
restrictions of a test, such as

Limitations of skills of a pen tester - It's hard to find professional pen testes.
Limitations of scope - most of the organizations leave some tests due to a resource, security constraints etc.,
Limitations of time
Limitations of budget
Limitations of tools used
Penetration Testing Tools:
Pen Testing Tools are classified into Vulnerability Scanners and Vulnerability Attackers. Vulnerability Scanners show you 
the weak spots of the system whereas Vulnerability Attackers show you the weak spots of the system and attack them.

Free Penetration Testing Tools:

Some of the free penetration testing tools (network vulnerability assessment tools/web vulnerability assessment tools) are 
NMap, Nessus, Metasploit, Wireshark, OpenSSL, Cain & Abel, W3af etc.,

Commercial Penetration Testing Tools:

Some of the commercial penetration testing tools are Pure Hacking, Torrid Networks, SecPoint, Veracode etc.,

How to choose a Penetration Testing Tools?
We need to choose a penetration testing based on the following points.

It should be easy to use
It should be easy to configure & deploy
It should scan vulnerabilities easily
Categorization of vulnerabilities based on the severity
It should generate detailed reports and logs
It should be cost-effective in terms of budget
A good support team & technical documentation is essential

103. All pair testing: All pair testing approach is to test the application with all possible combination of the values 
of input parameters.

104. Pairwise Testing: Refer All pair testing

Here I am going to conclude different types of software testing types. 

9. What is Grey Box Testing?

Grey box is the combination of both White Box and Black Box Testing. The tester who works on this type of testing needs 
to have access to design documents. This helps to create better test cases in this process.

10. What is Positive and Negative Testing?

Positive Testing: It is to determine what system supposed to do. It helps to check whether the application is justifying 
the requirements or not.

Negative Testing: It is to determine what system not supposed to do. It helps to find the defects from the software.

11. What is Test Strategy?

Test Strategy is a high-level document (static document) and usually developed by project manager. It is a document which 
captures the approach on how we go about testing the product and achieve the goals. It is normally derived from the Business 
Requirement Specification (BRS). Documents like Test Plan are prepared by keeping this document as a base.

12. What is Test Plan and contents available in a Test Plan?

Test plan document is a document which contains the plan for all the testing activities to be done to deliver a quality product. 
Test Plan document is derived from the Product Description, SRS, or Use Case documents for all future activities of the project. 
It is usually prepared by the Test Lead or Test Manager.

13. What is Test Suite?

Test Suite is a collection of test cases. The test cases which are intended to test an application.

14. What is Test Scenario?

Test Scenario gives the idea of what we have to test. Test Scenario is like a high-level test case.

15. What is Test Case?

Test cases are the set of positive and negative executable steps of a test scenario which has a set of pre-conditions, 
test data, expected result, post-conditions and actual results.

16. What is Test Bed?

An environment configured for testing. Test bed consists of hardware, software, network configuration, an application under 
test, other related software.

17. What is Test Environment?

Test Environment is the combination of hardware and software on which Test Team performs testing.

Example:

Application Type: Web Application
OS: Windows
Web Server: IIS
Web Page Design: Dot Net
Client Side Validation: JavaScript
Server Side Scripting: ASP Dot Net
Database: MS SQL Server
Browser: IE/FireFox/Chrome
18. What is Test Data?

Test data is the data that is used by the testers to run the test cases. Whilst running the test cases, testers need to 
enter some input data. To do so, testers prepare test data. It can be prepared manually and also by using tools.

For example, To test a basic login functionality having a user id, password fields. We need to enter some data in the user 
id and password fields. So we need to collect some test data.

19. What is Test Harness?

A test harness is the collection of software and test data configured to test a program unit by running it under varying 
conditions which involves monitoring the output with expected output.

20. What is Test Closure?

Test Closure is the note prepared before test team formally completes the testing process. This note contains the total 
no. of test cases, total no. of test cases executed, total no. of defects found, total no. of defects fixed, total no. of 
bugs not fixed, total no of bugs rejected etc.,

21. What are the tasks of Test Closure activities in Software Testing?

Test Closure activities fall into four major groups.

Test Completion Check: To ensure all tests should be either run or deliberately skipped and all known defects should be 
either fixed, deferred for a future release or accepted as a permanent restriction.

Test Artifacts handover: Tests and test environments should be handed over to those responsible for maintenance testing. 
Known defects accepted or deferred should be documented and communicated to those who will use and support the use of the 
system.

Lessons learned: Analyzing lessons learned to determine changes needed for future releases and projects. In retrospective 
meetings, plans are established to ensure that good
practices can be repeated and poor practices are not repeated

Archiving results, logs, reports, and other documents and work products in the CMS (configuration management system).

22. What is test coverage?

Test coverage helps in measuring the amount of testing performed by a set of tests.
Test coverage can be done on both functional and non-functional activities. It assists testers to create tests that 
cover areas which are missing.

23. What is Code coverage?

Code coverage is different from Test coverage. Code coverage is about unit testing practices that must target all areas 
of the code at least once. It is usually done by developers or unit testers.

24. List out Test Deliverables?

25. What is Unit Testing?

Unit Testing is also called as Module Testing or Component Testing. It is done to check whether the individual unit or 
module of the source code is working properly. It is done by the developers in the developer's environment.

26. What is Integration Testing?

Integration Testing is the process of testing the interface between the two software units. Integration testing is done 
by three ways. Big Bang Approach, Top-Down Approach, Bottom-Up Approach

27. What is System Testing?

Testing the fully integrated application to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements is called 
System Testing AKA End to End testing. Verifying the completed system to ensure that the application works as intended or not.

28. What is Big Bang Approach?

Combining all the modules once and verifying the functionality after completion of individual module testing.

Top down and bottom up are carried out by using dummy modules known as Stubs and Drivers. These Stubs and Drivers are 
used to stand-in for missing components to simulate data communication between modules.

29. What is Top-Down Approach?

Testing takes place from top to bottom. High-level modules are tested first and then low-level modules and finally 
integrating the low-level modules to a high level to ensure the system is working as intended. Stubs are used as a temporary 
module if a module is not ready for integration testing.

30. What is Bottom-Up Approach?

It is a reciprocate of the Top-Down Approach. Testing takes place from bottom to up. Lowest level modules are tested first 
and then high-level modules and finally integrating the high-level modules to a low level to ensure the system is working 
as intended.  Drivers are used as a temporary module for integration testing.

31. What is End-To-End Testing?

Refer System Testing.

32. What is Functional Testing?

In simple words, what the system actually does is functional testing. To verify that each function of the software 
application behaves as specified in the requirement document. Testing all the functionalities by providing appropriate 
input to verify whether the actual output is matching the expected output or not. It falls within the scope of black box 
testing and the testers need not concern about the source code of the application.

33. What is Non-Functional Testing?

In simple words, how well the system performs is non-functionality testing. Non-functional testing refers to various 
aspects of the software such as performance, load, stress, scalability, security, compatibility etc., Main focus is to 
improve the user experience on how fast the system responds to a request.

34. What is Acceptance Testing?

It is also known as pre-production testing.  This is done by the end users along with the testers to validate the functionality 
of the application. After successful acceptance testing. Formal testing conducted to determine whether an application is 
developed as per the requirement. It allows the customer to accept or reject the application. Types of acceptance testing 
are Alpha, Beta & Gamma.

35. What is Alpha Testing?

Alpha testing is done by the in-house developers (who developed the software) and testers. Sometimes alpha testing is done 
by the client or outsourcing team with the presence of developers or testers.

36. What is Beta Testing?

Beta testing is done by a limited number of end users before delivery. Usually, it is done in the client place.

37. What is Gamma Testing?

Gamma testing is done when the software is ready for release with specified requirements. It is done at the client place. 
It is done directly by skipping all the in-house testing activities.

38. What is Smoke Testing?

Smoke Testing is done to make sure if the build we received from the development team is testable or not. It is also called 
as "Day 0" check. It is done at the "build level". It helps not to waste the testing time to simply testing the whole application 
when the key features don't work or the key bugs have not been fixed yet.

39. What is Sanity Testing?

Sanity Testing is done during the release phase to check for the main functionalities of the application without going deeper. 
It is also called as a subset of Regression testing. It is done at the "release level". At times due to release time constraints 
rigorous regression testing can't be done to the build, sanity testing does that part by checking main functionalities.

40. What is Retesting?

To ensure that the defects which were found and posted in the earlier build were fixed or not in the current build. Say, 
Build 1.0 was released. Test team found some defects (Defect Id 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and posted. Build 1.1 was released, now testing 
the defects 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 in this build is retesting.

41. What is Regression Testing?

Repeated testing of an already tested program, after modification, to discover any defects introduced or uncovered as a 
result of the changes in the software being tested or in another related or unrelated software components.

Usually, we do regression testing in the following cases:

New functionalities are added to the application
Change Requirement (In organizations, we call it as CR)
Defect Fixing
Performance Issue Fix
Environment change (E.g., Updating the DB from MySQL to Oracle)
42. What is GUI Testing?

Graphical User Interface Testing is to test the interface between the application and the end user.

43. What is Recovery Testing?

Recovery testing is performed in order to determine how quickly the system can recover after the system crash or hardware 
failure. It comes under the type of non-functional testing.

44. What is Globalization Testing?
Globalization is a process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions 
without any changes.

45. What is Internationalization Testing (I18N Testing)?

Refer Globalization Testing.

46. What is Localization Testing (L10N Testing)?

Localization is a process of adapting globalization software for a specific region or language by adding local specific components.

47. What is Installation Testing?
It is to check whether the application is successfully installed and it is working as expected after installation.

48. What is Formal Testing?
It is a process where the testers test the application by having pre-planned procedures and proper documentation.

49. What is Risk Based Testing?

Identify the modules or functionalities which are most likely cause failures and then testing those functionalities.

50. What is Compatibility Testing?
It is to deploy and check whether the application is working as expected in a different combination of environmental components.

51. What is Exploratory Testing?
Usually, this process will be carried out by domain experts. They perform testing just by exploring the functionalities 
of the application without having the knowledge of the requirements.

52. What is Monkey Testing?

Perform abnormal action on the application deliberately in order to verify the stability of the application.

53. What is Usability Testing?

To verify whether the application is user-friendly or not and was comfortably used by an end user or not. The main 
focus in this testing is to check whether the end user can understand and operate the application easily or not. An 
application should be self-exploratory and must not require training to operate it.

54. What is Security Testing?

Security testing is a process to determine whether the system protects data and maintains functionality as intended.

55. What is Soak Testing?

Running a system at high load for a prolonged period of time to identify the performance problems is called Soak Testing.

56. What is Endurance Testing?

Endurance testing is a non-functional testing type. It is also known as Soak Testing. Refer Soak testing.

57. What is Performance Testing?

This type of testing determines or validates the speed, scalability, and/or stability characteristics of the system or 
application under test. Performance is concerned with achieving response times, throughput, and resource-utilization 
levels that meet the performance objectives for the project or product.

58. What is Load Testing?

It is to verify that the system/application can handle the expected number of transactions and to verify the system/application 
behavior under both normal and peak load conditions.

59. What is Volume Testing?

It is to verify that the system/application can handle a large amount of data

60. What is Stress Testing?

It is to verify the behavior of the system once the load increases more than its design expectations.

61. What is Scalability Testing?

Scalability testing is a type of non-functional testing. It is to determine how the application under test scales with 
increasing workload.

62. What is Concurrency Testing?

Concurrency testing means accessing the application at the same time by multiple users to ensure the stability of the system. 
This is mainly used to identify deadlock issues.

63. What is Fuzz Testing?

Fuzz testing is used to identify coding errors and security loopholes in an application. By inputting massive amount of random 
data to the system in an attempt to make it crash to identify if anything breaks in the application.

64. What is Adhoc Testing?

Ad-hoc testing is quite opposite to the formal testing. It is an informal testing type. In Adhoc testing, testers randomly test 
the application without following any documents and test design techniques. This testing is primarily performed if the knowledge 
of testers in the application under test is very high. Testers randomly test the application without any test cases or any 
business requirement document.

65. What is Interface Testing?

Interface testing is performed to evaluate whether two intended modules pass data and communicate correctly to one another.

66. What is Reliability Testing?
Perform testing on the application continuously for long period of time in order to verify the stability of the application

67. What is Bucket Testing?

Bucket testing is a method to compare two versions of an application against each other to determine which one performs better.

68. What is A/B Testing?

Refer Bucket Testing.

69. What is Split Testing?

Refer Bucket Testing.

70. What are the principles of Software Testing?

Testing shows presence of defects
Exhaustive testing is impossible
Early testing
Defect clustering
Pesticide Paradox
Testing is context depending
Absence of error fallacy

71. What is Exhaustive Testing?

Testing all the functionalities using all valid and invalid inputs and preconditions is known as Exhaustive testing.

72. What is Early Testing?

Defects detected in early phases of SDLC are less expensive to fix. So conducting early testing reduces the cost of 
fixing defects.

73. What is Defect clustering?

Defect clustering in software testing means that a small module or functionality contains most of the bugs or it has the 
most operational failures.

74. What is Pesticide Paradox?

Pesticide Paradox in software testing is the process of repeating the same test cases, again and again, eventually, the 
same test cases will no longer find new bugs. So to overcome this Pesticide Paradox, it is necessary to review the test 
cases regularly and add or update them to find more defects.

75. What is Defect Cascading in Software Testing?

Defect cascading in Software testing means triggering of other defects in an application. When a defect is not identified 
or goes unnoticed while testing, it invokes other defects. It leads to multiple defects in the later stages and results 
in an increase in a number of defects in the application.

For example, if there is a defect in an accounting system related to negative taxation then the negative taxation defect 
affects the ledger which in turn affects other reports such as Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss etc.,

76. What is Walk Through?

A walkthrough is an informal meeting conducts to learn, gain understanding, and find defects. The author leads the meeting 
and clarifies the queries raised by the peers in the meeting.

77. What is Inspection?

Inspection is a formal meeting lead by a trained moderator, certainly not by the author. The document under inspection is 
prepared and checked thoroughly by the reviewers before the meeting. In the inspection meeting, the defects found are logged 
and shared with the author for appropriate actions. Post inspection, a formal follow-up process is used to ensure a timely 
and corrective action.

78. Who are all involved in an inspection meeting?

Author, Moderator, Reviewer(s), Scribe/Recorder and Manager.

79. What is a Defect?

The variation between the actual results and expected results is known as a defect. If a developer finds an issue and 
corrects it by himself in the development phase then it's called a defect.

80. What is a Bug?

If testers find any mismatch in the application/system in testing phase then they call it as Bug.

81. What is an Error?

We can't compile or run a program due to a coding mistake in a program. If a developer unable to successfully 
compile or run a program then they call it as an error.

82. What is a Failure?

Once the product is deployed and customers find any issues then they call the product as a failure product. After 
release, if an end user finds an issue then that particular issue is called as a failure.

83. What is Bug Severity?

Bug/Defect severity can be defined as the impact of the bug on customer's business. It can be Critical, Major or 
Minor. In simple words, how much effect will be there on the system because of a particular defect.

84. What is Bug Priority?

Defect priority can be defined as how soon the defect should be fixed. It gives the order in which a defect should be resolved. 
Developers decide which defect they should take up next based on the priority. It can be High, Medium or Low. Most of the 
times the priority status is set based on the customer requirement.

85. Tell some examples of Bug Severity and Bug Priority?

High Priority & High Severity: Submit button is not working on a login page and customers are unable to login to the application

Low Priority & High Severity: Crash in some functionality which is going to deliver after couple of releases

High Priority & Low Severity: Spelling mistake of a company name on the homepage

Low Priority & Low Severity: FAQ page takes a long time to load

86. What is a Critical Bug?

A critical bug is a show stopper which means a large piece of functionality or major system component is completely broken 
and there is no workaround to move further.
For example, Due to a bug in one module, we cannot test the other modules because that blocker bug has blocked other modules. 
Bugs which affects the customers business are considered as critical.

Example:

1. "Sign In" button is not working on Gmail App and Gmail users are blocked to login to their accounts.
2. An error message pops up when a customer clicks on transfer money button in a Banking website.

87. What is the difference between a Standalone application, Client-Server application and Web application?

Standalone application:

Standalone applications follow one-tier architecture. Presentation, Business, and Database layer are in one system for a 
single user.

Client-Server Application:

Client-server applications follow two-tier architecture. Presentation and Business layer are in a client system and Database 
layer on another server. It works majorly in Intranet.

Web Application:

Web server applications follow three-tier or n-tier architecture. The presentation layer is in a client system, a Business 
layer is in an application server and Database layer is in a Database server. It works both in Intranet and Internet.

88. What is Bug Life Cycle?

Bug life cycle is also known as Defect life cycle. In Software Development process, the bug has a life cycle. The bug should 
go through the life cycle to be closed. Bug life cycle varies depends upon the tools (QC, JIRA etc.,) used and the process 
followed in the organization.

89. What is Bug Leakage?

A bug which is actually missed by the testing team while testing and the build was released to the Production. If now that 
bug (which was missed by the testing team) was found by the end user or customer then we call it as Bug Leakage.

90. What is Bug Release?

Releasing the software to the Production with the known bugs then we call it as Bug Release. These known bugs should be 
included in the release note.

91. What is Defect Age?

Defect age can be defined as the time interval between date of defect detection and date of defect closure.

Defect Age = Date of defect closure - Date of defect detection

Assume, a tester found a bug and reported it on 1 Jan 2016 and it was successfully fixed on 5 Jan 2016. So the defect age 
is 5 days.

92. What is Error Seeding?

Error seeding is a process of adding known errors intendedly in a program to identify the rate of error detection. It helps 
in the process of estimating the tester skills of finding bugs and also to know the ability of the application (how well 
the application is working when it has errors.)

93. What is Showstopper Defect?

A showstopper defect is a defect which won't allow a user to move further in the application. It's almost like a crash.

Assume that login button is not working. Even though you have a valid username and valid password, you could not move further 
because the login button is not functioning.

94. What is HotFix?

A bug which needs to handle as a high priority bug and fix it immediately.

95. What is Boundary Value Analysis?

Boundary value analysis (BVA) is based on testing the boundary values of valid and invalid partitions. The Behavior at the 
edge of each equivalence partition is more likely to be incorrect than the behavior within the partition, so boundaries are 
an area where testing is likely to yield defects. Every partition has its maximum and minimum values and these maximum and 
minimum values are the boundary values of a partition. A boundary value for a valid partition is a valid boundary value. 
Similarly, a boundary value for an invalid partition is an invalid boundary value.

96. What is Equivalence Class Partition?

Equivalence Partitioning is also known as Equivalence Class Partitioning. In equivalence partitioning, inputs to the 
software or system are divided into groups that are expected to exhibit similar behavior, so they are likely to be proposed 
in the same way. Hence selecting one input from each group to design the test cases.

97. What is Decision Table testing?

Decision Table is aka Cause-Effect Table. This test technique is appropriate for functionalities which has logical 
relationships between inputs (if-else logic). In Decision table technique, we deal with combinations of inputs. To identify 
the test cases with decision table, we consider conditions and actions. We take conditions as inputs and actions as outputs.

98. What is State Transition?

Using state transition testing, we pick test cases from an application where we need to test different system transitions. 
We can apply this when an application gives a different output for the same input, depending on what has happened in the 
earlier state.

99. What is an entry criteria?

The prerequisites that must be achieved before commencing the testing process. 

100. What is an exit criteria?

The conditions that must be met before testing should be concluded.

101. What is SDLC?

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) aims to produce a high-quality system that meets or exceeds customer expectations, 
works effectively and efficiently in the current and planned information technology infrastructure, and is inexpensive to 
maintain and cost-effective to enhance.

102. What are the different available models of SDLC?

Waterfall
Spiral
V Model
Prototype
Agile

<b id="Software Development Life Cycle:">Software Development Life Cycle:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

Before start reading Waterfall Model, I would suggest you to check this post "Software Development Life Cycle"

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) aims to produce a high-quality system that meets or exceeds customer expectations, 
works effectively and efficiently in the current and planned information technology infrastructure, and is inexpensive to 
maintain and cost-effective to enhance.

Detailed Explanation:
A process followed in software projects is SDLC. Each phase of SDLC produces deliverables required by the next phase in 
the life cycle. Requirements are translated into design. Code is produced according to the design. Testing should be done 
on a developed product based on requirement. Deployment should be done once the testing was completed. It aims to produce a 
high-quality system that meets or exceeds customer expectations, works effectively and efficiently in the current and planned 
information technology infrastructure, and is inexpensive to maintain and cost-effective to enhance.

A typical Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of the following phases:

Requirement Phase:
Requirement gathering and analysis is the most important phase in software development lifecycle. Business Analyst collects 
the requirement from the Customer/Client as per the clients business needs and documents the requirements in the Business 
Requirement Specification (document name varies depends upon the Organization. Some examples are Customer Requirement 
Specification (CRS), Business Specification (BS) etc., and provides the same to Development Team.

Analysis Phase:
Once the requirement gathering and analysis is done the next step is to define and document the product requirements and get 
them approved by the customer. This is done through SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document. SRS consists of all the 
product requirements to be designed and developed during the project life cycle. Key people involved in this phase are Project 
Manager, Business Analysist and Senior members of the Team. The outcome of this phase is Software Requirement Specification.

Design Phase:
It has two steps:
HLD - High Level Design - It gives the architecture of the software product to be developed and is done by architects and senior 
developers
LLD - Low Level Design - It is done by senior developers. It describes how each and every feature in the product should work and 
how every component should work. Here, only the design will be there and not the code
The outcome from this phase is High Level Document and Low Level Document which works as an input to the next phase

Development Phase:
Developers of all levels (seniors, juniors, freshers) involved in this phase. This is the phase where we start building the 
software and start writing the code for the product. The outcome from this phase is Source Code Document (SCD) and the developed 
product.

Testing Phase:
When the software is ready, it is sent to the testing department where Test team tests it thoroughly for different defects. 
They either test the software manually or using automated testing tools depends on process defined in STLC (Software Testing 
Life Cycle) and ensure that each and every component of the software works fine. Once the QA makes sure that the software is 
error-free, it goes to the next stage, which is Implementation. The outcome of this phase is the Quality Product and the Testing 
Artifacts.

Deployment & Maintenance Phase:
After successful testing, the product is delivered/deployed to the customer for their use. Deployment is done by the 
Deployment/Implementation engineers. Once when the customers start using the developed system then the actual problems will come 
up and needs to be solved from time to time. Fixing the issues found by the customer comes in the maintenance phase. 100% 
testing is not possible - because, the way testers test the product is different from the way customers use the product. 
Maintenance should be done as per SLA (Service Level Agreement)


Types of Software Development Life Cycle Models:
Some of the SDLC Models are as follows:

Waterfall Model
Spiral
V Model
Prototype
Agile

The other related models are Agile Model, Rapid Application Development, Rational Unified Model, Hybrid Model etc.,

<b id="Software Testing Life Cycle:">Software Testing Life Cycle:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

Software Testing Life Cycle:
Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) identifies what test activities to carry out and when to accomplish those test activities. 
Even though testing differs between Organizations, there is a testing life cycle.

Every phase of STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) has a definite Entry and Exit Criteria.

Requirement Analysis:
Entry criteria for this phase is BRS (Business Requirement Specification) document. During this phase, test team studies and 
analyzes the requirements from a testing perspective. This phase helps to identify whether the requirements are testable or not. 
If any requirement is not testable, test team can communicate with various stakeholders (Client, Business Analyst, Technical 
Leads, System Architects etc) during this phase so that the mitigation strategy can be planned.

Entry Criteria: BRS (Business Requirement Specification)
Deliverables: List of all testable requirements, Automation feasibility report (if applicable)

Test Planning:
Test planning is the first step of the testing process. In this phase typically Test Manager/Test Lead involves determining 
the effort and cost estimates for the entire project. Preparation of Test Plan will be done based on the requirement analysis. 
Activities like resource planning, determining roles and responsibilities, tool selection (if automation), training requirement 
etc., carried out in this phase. The deliverables of this phase are Test Plan & Effort estimation documents.

Entry Criteria: Requirements Documents
Deliverables: Test Strategy, Test Plan, and Test Effort estimation document.

Test Design:
Test team starts with test cases development activity here in this phase. Test team prepares test cases, test scripts (if 
automation) and test data. Once the test cases are ready then these test cases are reviewed by peer members or team lead. Also, 
test team prepares the Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM). RTM traces the requirements to the test cases that are needed to 
verify whether the requirements are fulfilled. The deliverables of this phase are Test Cases, Test Scripts, Test Data, 
Requirements Traceability Matrix

Entry Criteria: Requirements Documents (Updated version of unclear or missing requirement)
Deliverables: Test cases, Test Scripts (if automation), Test data.

Test Environment Setup:
This phase can be started in parallel with Test design phase. Test environment setup is done based on the hardware and software 
requirement list. Some cases test team may not be involved in this phase. Development team or customer provides the test 
environment. Meanwhile, test team should prepare the smoke test cases to check the readiness of the given test environment.

Entry Criteria: Test Plan, Smoke Test cases, Test Data
Deliverables: Test Environment. Smoke Test Results.

Test Execution:
Test team starts executing the test cases based on the planned test cases. If a test case result is Pass/Fail then the same 
should be updated in the test cases. Defect report should be prepared for failed test cases and should be reported to the 
Development Team through bug tracking tool (eg., Quality Center) for fixing the defects. Retesting will be performed once 
the defect was fixed.

Entry Criteria: Test Plan document, Test cases, Test data, Test Environment.
Deliverables: Test case execution report, Defect report, RTM

Test Closure:
The final stage where we prepare Test Closure Report, Test Metrics.
Testing team will be called out for a meeting to evaluate cycle completion criteria based on Test coverage, Quality, Time, 
Cost, Software, Business objectives. Test team analyses the test artifacts (such as Test cases, Defect reports etc.,) to 
identify strategies that have to be implemented in future, which will help to remove process bottlenecks in the upcoming projects. 
Test metrics and Test closure report will be prepared based on the above criteria.

Entry Criteria: Test Case Execution report (make sure there are no high severity defects opened), Defect report
Deliverables: Test Closure report, Test metrics

<b id="Waterfall Model:">Waterfall Model:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

Waterfall Model:
Waterfall Model is a traditional model. It is aka Sequential Design Process, often used in SDLC, in which the progress is seen 
as flowing downwards like a waterfall, through the different phases such as Requirement Gathering, Feasibility Study/Analysis, 
Design, Coding, Testing, Installation and Maintenance. Every next phase is begun only once the goal of previous phase is completed. 
This methodology is preferred in projects where quality is more important as compared to schedule or cost. This methodology is 
best suitable for short term projects where the requirements will not change. (E.g. Calculator, Attendance Management)

Advantages:
Requirements do not change nor does design and code, so we get a stable product.
This model is simple to implement. Requirements are finalized earlier in the life cycle. So there won't be any chaos in the next 
phases.
Required resources to implement this model are minimal compared to other methodologies
Every phase has specific deliverable's. It gives high visibility to the project manager and clients about the progress of the 
project.

Disadvantages:
Backtracking is not possible i.e., we cannot go back and change requirements once the design stage is reached.
Change in requirements leads to change in design and code which results defects in the project due to overlapping of phases.
Customer may not be satisfied, if the changes they required are not incorporated in the product.
The end result of waterfall model may not be a flexible product
In terms of testing, testers involve only in the testing phase. Requirements are not tested in the requirement phase. It can't 
be modified even though we identify that there is a bug in the requirement in the testing phase. It goes on till the end and 
leads to lot of re-work.
It is not suitable for long term projects where requirements may change time to time
Waterfall model can be used only when the requirements are very well known and fixed

Final words: Testing is not just finding bugs. As per the Waterfall Model, Testers involve only almost at the end of the SDLC. 
Ages ago the mantra of testing is just to finding bugs in the software. Things changed a lot now. There are some other SDLC models 
implemented. I would post other models in the upcoming posts in detail with their advantages and disadvantages. It is up to your 
team to choose the SDLC model depends on the project you are working.

<b id="Spiral Model:">Spiral Model:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

Spiral Model:
Spiral Model was first described by Barry W. Boehm (American Software Engineer) in 1986.

Spiral model works in an iterative nature. It is a combination of both Prototype development process and Linear development 
process (waterfall model). This model place more emphasis on risk analysis. Mostly this model adpots to the large and complicated 
projects where risk is high. Every Iteration starts with a planning and ends with the product evaluation by client.

Let's take an example of a product development team (like Microsoft). They know that there will be a high risk and they face 
lots of difficulties in the journey of developing and releasing the product
and also they know that they will release next version of product when the current version is in existence. They prefer Spiral 
Model to develop the product in an iterative nature. They could release one version of the product to the end user and start 
developing next version which includes new enhancements and improvements on previous version (based on the issues faced by the 
user in the previous version). Like Microsoft released Windows 8 and improved it based on user feedback and released the next 
version (Windows 8.1).

Spiral Model undergoes 4 phases.

Planning Phase - Requirement Gathering, Cost Estimation, Resource Allocation
Risk Analysis Phase - Strengths and weaknesses of the project
Design Phase - Coding, Internal Testing and deployment
Evaluation Phase - Client Evaluation (Client side Testing) to get the feedback

Advantages:

It allows requirement changes
Suitable for large and complicated projects
It allows better risk analysis
Cost effective due to good risk management

Disadvantages:
Not suitable for small projects
Success of the project depends on risk analysis phase
Have to hire more experienced resource especially for risk analysis

<b id="V Model:">V Model:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

V Model:
V-model is also known as Verification and Validation (V&V) model. In this each phase of SDLC must be completed before the 
next phase starts. It follows a sequential design process same like waterfall model.

Don't you think that why do we use this V Model, if it is same as Waterfall Model. 🙂

Let me mention the next point on why do we need this Verification and Validation Model.

It overcomes the disadvantages of waterfall model. In the waterfall model, we have seen that testers involve in the project 
only at the last phase of the development process.

If you didn't go through the waterfall model, click here.

In this, test team involves in the early phases of SDLC. Testing starts in early stages of product development which avoids 
downward flow of defects which in turns reduces lot of rework. Both teams (test and development) work in parallel. The test 
team works on various activities like preparing test strategy, test plan and test cases/scripts while the development team 
works on SRS, Design and Coding.

Once the requirements were received, both the development and test team start their activities.

Deliverables are parallel in this model. Whilst, developers are working on SRS (System Requirement Specification), testers 
work on BRS (Business Requirement Specification) and prepare ATP(Acceptance Test Plan) and ATC (Acceptance Test Cases) and so on.

Testers will be ready with all the required artifacts (such as Test Plan, Test Cases)  by the time developers release the 
finished product. It saves lots of time.

Let's see the how the development team and test team involves in each phase of SDLC in V Model.

1. Once client sends BRS, both the teams (test and development) start their activities. The developers translate the BRS to 
SRS. The test team involves in reviewing the BRS to find the missing or wrong requirements and writes acceptance test plan 
and acceptance test cases.

2. In the next stage, the development team sends the SRS the testing team for review and the developers start building the 
HLD (High Level Design Document) of the product. The test team involves in reviewing the SRS against the BRS and writes 
system test plan and test cases.

3. In the next stage, the development team starts building the LLD (Low Level Design) of the product. The test team involves 
in reviewing the HLD (High Level Design) and writes Integration test plan and integration test cases.

4. In the next stage, the development team starts with the coding of the product. The test team involves in reviewing the 
LLD and writes functional test plan and functional test cases.

5. In the next stage, the development team releases the build to the test team once the unit testing was done. The test 
team carries out functional testing, integration testing, system testing and acceptance testing on the release build step 
by step.

Advantages:

Testing starts in early stages of product development which avoids downward flow of defects and helps to find the defects 
in the early stages
Test team will be ready with the test cases by the time developers release the software which in turns saves a lot of time
Testing is involved in every stage of product development. It gives a quality product.
Total investment is less due to less or no rework.

Disadvantages:

Initial investment is more because test team involves right from the early stage.
Whenever there is change in requirement, the same procedure continues. It leads more documentation work.
Applications:

Long term projects, complex applications, When customer is expecting a very high quality product with in stipulated time 
frame because every stage is tested and developers & testers are working in parallel

<b id="Agile:">Agile:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

Agile Scrum Methodology is one of the popular Agile software development methods. There are some other Agile software 
development methods but the popular one which is using widely is Agile Scrum Methodology. The Agile Scrum Methodology 
is a combination of both Incremental and Iterative model for managing product development.

In Scrum, the project is divided into Sprints.

Sprint: Each Sprint has a specified time line (2 weeks to 1 month). This time line will be agreed by a Scrum Team during 
the Sprint Planning Meeting. Here, User Stories are split in to different modules. End result of every Sprint should be 
potentially shippable product.

The three important aspects involved in Scrum such as Roles, Artifacts and Meetings:

ROLES IN AGILE SCRUM METHODOLOGY:
Product Owner:

Product Owner usually represents the Client and acts as a point of contact from Client side. The one who prioritizes the 
list of Product Backlogs which Scrum Team should finish and release.

Scrum Master:

Scrum Master acts as a facilitator to the Scrum Development Team. Clarifies the queries and organizes the team from 
distractions and teach team how to use scrum and also concentrates on Return on Investment (ROI).

Scrum Development Team:

Developer's, QA's. Who develops the product. Scrum development team decides the effort estimation to complete a 
Product Backlog Item.

Scrum Team:

A cross-functional, self-organizing group of dedicated people (Group of Product Owner, Business Analyst, Developer's 
and QA's). Recommended size of a scrum team is 7 plus or minus 2 (i.e, between 5 to 9 members in a team)

ARTIFACTS IN AGILE SCRUM METHODOLOGY:
User Stories:

User Stories are not like a traditional requirement documents. In User Stories, stake holder mention what features 
they need and what they want to achieve.

Product Backlog:

Product Backlog is a repository where the list of Product Backlog Items stored and maintained by the Product Owner. 
The list of Product Backlog Items are prioritized by the Product Owner as high and low and also could re-prioritize 
the product backlog constantly.

Sprint Backlog:

Group of user stories which scrum development team agreed to do during the current sprint (Committed Product Backlog items)

Product Burn down Chart:

A graph which shows how many Product Backlog Items (User Stories) implemented/not implemented.

Sprint Burn down Chart:

A graph which shows how many Sprints implemented/not implemented by Scrum Team.

Release Burn down Chart:

A graph which shows List of releases still pending, which Scrum Team have planned.

Defect Burn down Chart:

A graph which shows how many defects identified and fixed.

Note: Burn Down Charts provide proof that the project is on track or not.

MEETINGS IN AGILE SCRUM METHODOLOGY:
Sprint Planning Meeting:

The first step of Scrum is Sprint Planning Meeting where the entire Scrum Team attends. Here the Product Owner selects the 
Product Backlog Items (User Stories) from the Product Backlog.
Most important User Stories at the top of the list and least important User Stories at the bottom. Scrum Development Team 
decides and provides the effort estimation.

Daily Scrum Meeting: (Daily Stand-up)

Daily Scrum is also known as Daily Stand-up meeting. Here each team member reports to the peer team member on what he/she 
did yesterday, what he/she going to do today and what obstacles are impeding in their progress. Reporting will be between 
peers not to Scrum Master or Product Owner. Daily Scrum will be approximately 15 mins.

Sprint Review Meeting:

In the Sprint Review Meeting, Scrum Development Team presents a demonstration of a potentially shippable product. Product 
Owner declares which items are completed and not completed. Product Owner adds the additional items to the product backlog 
based on the stakeholders feedback.

Sprint Retrospective Meeting:

Scrum Team meets again after the Sprint Review Meeting and documents the lessons learnt in the earlier sprint such as "What 
went well", "What could be improved". It helps the Scrum Team to avoid the mistakes in the next Sprints.

When do we use Agile Scrum Methodology?
The client is not so clear on requirements
The client expects quick releases
The client doesn't give all the requirements at a time

Conclusion:
In an Agile Scrum Methodology, all the members in a Scrum Team gathers and finalize the Product Backlog Items (User Stories) 
for a particular Sprint and commits time line to release the product. Based on the Daily Scrum meetings, Scrum Development 
Team develops and tests the product and presents to the Product Owner on Sprint Review Meeting. If the Product Owner accepts 
all the developed User Stories then the Sprint is completed and the Scrum Team goes for the next Sprint in a same manner.

103. Can you do System testing at any stage of SDLC?

We can do System Testing only when all the units are in place and working properly. It can only be done before User 
Acceptance Testing (UAT).

104. What is the procedure of manual testing?

Manual testing is crucial for testing software applications more thoroughly. The procedure of manual testing comprises 
of the following.
1. Planning and Control
2. Analysis and Design
3. Implementation and Execution
4. Evaluating and Reporting
5. Test Closure activities

105. What is STLC?

STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) identifies what test activities to carry out and when to accomplish those test 
activities. Even though testing differs between Organizations, there is a testing life cycle.

106. What is RTM?

Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is used to trace the requirements to the tests that are needed to verify whether 
the requirements are fulfilled. Requirement Traceability Matrix AKA Traceability Matrix or Cross Reference Matrix.

107. What is Test Metrics?

Software test metrics is to monitor and control process and product. It helps to drive the project towards our planned 
goals without deviation. Metrics answer different questions. It's important to decide what questions you want answers to. 

108. When to stop testing? (Or) How do you decide when you have tested enough?

There are many factors involved in the real-time projects to decide when to stop testing.

Testing deadlines or release deadlines
By reaching the decided pass percentage of test cases
The risk in the project is under acceptable limit
All the high priority bugs, blockers are fixed
When acceptance criteria is met
As per ISTQB, It depends on the risks for the system being tested.

Congratulations! You got the interview! In this SQL Server Developer Interview Questions post, we have put together both 
basic and advanced SQL Interview Questions and Answers. This post contains Top SQL Interview Questions for Experienced as 
well as Freshers.

I have segregated this "SQL Server Interview Questions" post into two types.

1. Common SQL Interview Questions
2. Practical SQL Query Interview Questions (SQL Server Queries examples with answers).

I don't want to take much time of yours but I couldn't move further without mentioning about this inevitable job interview 
question which every hiring manager asks you in any interview i.e., Tell Me About Yourself. Answering these questions is very 
easy if you follow the link. It contains sample answers for both freshers and experienced. Now, Let's move on to the actual post.

General SQL Interview Questions:
1. What is a Database?
A database is a collection of information in an organized form for faster and better access, storage and manipulation. It can 
also be defined as a collection of tables, schema, views, and other database objects.

2. What is Data warehouse?
Data warehouse refers to a central repository of data from multiple sources of information. Those data are consolidated, 
transformed and made available for the mining as well as online processing.

3. What is a Table in a Database?
A table is a database object used to store records in a field in the form of columns and rows that holds data.

4. What is a Field in a Database?
A field in a Database table is a space allocated to store a particular record within a table.

5. What is a Record in a Database?
A record (also called a row of data) is an ordered set of related data in a table.

6. What is a column in a Table?
A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.

7. What is DBMS?
Database Management System is a collection of programs that enables a user to store, retrieve, update and delete information 
from a database.

8. What are the types of DBMS?
There are two types of DBMS
1. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
2. Non-Relational Database Management System

9. What is RDBMS?
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the 
relational model. Data from a relational database can be accessed using Structured Query Language (SQL)

10. What are the popular Database Management Systems in the IT Industry?
Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Sybase, MongoDB, DB2, and Microsoft Access etc.,

11. What is SQL?
SQL Overview: SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is an American National Standard Institute (ANSI) standard. 
It is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. Using SQL, some of the action we could do are to create 
databases, tables, stored procedures (SP's), execute queries, retrieve, insert, update, delete data against a database.

12. What are the different types of SQL commands?
SQL commands are segregated into the following types:

DDL - Data Definition Language
DML - Data Manipulation Language
DQL - Data Query Language
DCL - Data Control Language
TCL - Transaction Control Language

13. What are the different DDL commands in SQL?
DDL commands are used to define or alter the structure of the database.

CREATE: To create databases and database objects
ALTER: To alter existing database objects
DROP: To drop databases and databases objects
TRUNCATE: To remove all records from a table but not its database structure
RENAME: To rename database objects
14. What are the different DML commands in SQL?
DML commands are used for managing data present in the database.

SELECT: To select specific data from a database
INSERT: To insert new records into a table
UPDATE: To update existing records
DELETE: To delete existing records from a table
15. What are the different DCL commands in SQL?
DCL commands are used to create roles, grant permission and control access to the database objects.

GRANT: To provide user access
DENY: To deny permissions to users
REVOKE: To remove user access
16. What are the different TCL commands in SQL?
TCL commands are used to manage the changes made by DML statements.

COMMIT: To write and store the changes to the database
ROLLBACK: To restore the database since the last commit
17. What is an Index?
An index is used to speed up the performance of queries. It makes faster retrieval of data from the table. The index can be 
created on one column or a group of columns.

18. What are all the different types of indexes?
There are three types of indexes
1. Unique Index: Unique Indexes helps maintain data integrity by ensuring that no two rows of data in a table have identical 
key values. A unique index can be applied automatically when a primary key is defined. It ensures that the values in the index
key columns are unique.
2. Clustered Index: Clustered Index reorders the physical order of the table and search based on the key values. There will 
be only one clustered index per table.
3. Non-Clustered Index: Non-Clustered Index doesn't alter the physical order of the table and maintains a logical order of 
the data. Each table can have many non-clustered indexes.
19. What is the difference between Cluster and Non-Cluster Index?
The difference between the clustered and non-clustered index in SQL is as follows:
Clustered Index: 
It is used for easy retrieval of data from the database and it is faster.
One table can only have one clustered index
It alters the way records are stored in a database as it sorts out rows by the column which is set to be clustered index.
Non-Clustered Index: 
It is slower compared to the Clustered index.
One table can have multiple non clustered index
It doesn't alter the way it was sorted but it creates a separate object within a table which points back to the original table 
rows after searching.

20. What is a View?
A view is like a subset of a table which is stored logically in a database. A view is a virtual table. It contains rows and 
columns similar to a real table. The fields in the view are fields from one or more real tables. Views do not contain data of 
their own. They are used to restrict access to the database or to hide data complexity.

<table class="crayon-table" style=""><tbody><tr class="crayon-row"><td class="crayon-nums " data-settings="show"><div class="crayon-nums-content" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important;"><div class="crayon-num" data-line="crayon-5cba5e6c8085f137439610-1">1</div></div></td><td class="crayon-code"><div class="crayon-pre" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important; -moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4;"><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5cba5e6c8085f137439610-1"><span class="crayon-e">CREATE </span><span class="crayon-e">VIEW </span><span class="crayon-e">view_name </span><span class="crayon-st">AS</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">SELECT </span><span class="crayon-v">column_name1</span><span class="crayon-sy">,</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">column_name2 </span><span class="crayon-e">FROM </span><span class="crayon-e">table_name </span><span class="crayon-e">WHERE </span><span class="crayon-v">CONDITION</span><span class="crayon-sy">;</span></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

21. What are the advantages of Views?
Some of the advantages of Views are

Views occupy no space
Views are used to simply retrieve the results of complicated queries that need to be executed often.
Views are used to restrict access to the database or to hide data complexity.
22. What is a relationship and what are they?
Database Relationship is defined as the connection between the tables in a database. There are various database relationships 
namely
1. One to One Relationship
2. One to Many Relationship
3. Many to One Relationship
4. Self-Referencing Relationship

23. What is a query?
A database query is a request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables. A database query can be 
either a select query or an action query.

24. What is a Subquery? 
A Subquery is a SQL query within another query. It is a subset of a Select statement whose return values are used in filtering 
the conditions of the main query.

25. What are the types of subquery?
There are two types of subquery:
1. Correlated: In a SQL database query, a correlated subquery is a subquery that uses values from the outer query in order to 
complete. Because a correlated subquery requires the outer query to be executed first, the correlated subquery must run once 
for every row in the outer query. It is also known as a synchronized subquery.
2. Non-Correlated: A Non-correlated subquery is a subquery in which both outer query and inner query are independent to each 
other.

26. What is Synchronized Subquery?
Refer Correlated Subquery.

27. What is the difference between Local Variables and Global Variables?
Local Variables: Local variables can be used or exist only inside the function. These variables are not used or referred by 
any other functions. These are not known to other functions. Variables can be created whenever that function is called.
Global Variables: Global variables can be used or exist throughout the program. Same variable declared in global cannot be 
used in functions. Global variables cannot be created whenever that function is called.

28. What is data Integrity?
Data integrity defines the accuracy and consistency of the data stored in a database. It also defines integrity constraints to 
enforce business rules on the data when it is entered into an application or a database.

29. What is Auto Increment in SQL?
It is one of the important Oracle DBA Interview Questions.
Auto increment keyword allows the user to create a unique number to get generated when a new record is inserted into a table. 
Auto increment keyword can be used whenever Primary Key is used.

AUTO INCREMENT keyword is used in Oracle and IDENTITY keyword is used in SQL Server.

30. What is a temp table?
Ans. A temp table is a temporary storage structure to store the data temporarily.

31. How to avoid duplicate records in a query? 
The SQL SELECT DISTINCT query is used to return only unique values. It eliminates all the duplicated values.

32. What is the difference between Rename and Alias?
'Rename' is a permanent name given to a table or column
'Alias' is a temporary name given to a table or column.

33. What is a Join?
Join is a query, which retrieves related columns or rows from multiple tables.

34. What are the different types of joins?
Types of Joins are as follows:

INNER JOIN
LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
OUTER JOIN

35. What is the difference between an inner and outer join?
An inner join returns rows when there is at least some matching data between two (or more) tables that are being compared.
An outer join returns rows from both tables that include the records that are unmatched from one or both the tables.

36. What are SQL constraints?
SQL constraints are the set of rules that enforced some restriction while inserting, deleting or updating of data in the databases.

37. What are the constraints available in SQL?
Some of the constraints in SQL are - Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique Key, SQL Not Null, Default, Check and Index constraint.

38. What is a Unique constraint?
A unique constraint is used to ensure that there are no duplication values in the field/column.

39. What is a Primary Key?
A PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a database table. All columns participating in a primary key 
constraint must not contain NULL values.

40. Can a table contain multiple PRIMARY KEY's?

The short answer is no, a table is not allowed to contain multiple primary keys but it allows to have one composite primary 
key consisting of two or more columns.

41. What is a Composite PRIMARY KEY?
Composite PRIMARY KEY is a primary key created on more than one column (combination of multiple fields) in a table.

42. What is a FOREIGN KEY?
A FOREIGN KEY is a key used to link two tables together. A FOREIGN KEY in a table is linked with the PRIMARY KEY of another 
table.

43. Can a table contain multiple FOREIGN KEY's?
A table can have many FOREIGN KEY's.

44. What is the difference between UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints?
There should be only one PRIMARY KEY in a table whereas there can be any number of UNIQUE Keys.
PRIMARY KEY doesn't allow NULL values whereas Unique key allows NULL values.

45. What is a NULL value?
A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains 
spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation. Assume, there is a field in a 
table is optional and it is possible to insert a record without adding a value to the optional field then the field will 
be saved with a NULL value.

46. What is the difference between NULL value, Zero, and Blank space?
As I mentioned earlier, Null value is field with no value which is different from zero value and blank space.
Null value is a field with no value.
Zero is a number
Blank space is the value we provide. The ASCII value of space is CHAR(32).

47. How to Test for NULL Values?
A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. NULL value cannot be compared with other NULL values. Hence, It is not 
possible to test for NULL values with comparison operators, such as =, <, or <>. For this, we have to use the IS NULL and 
IS NOT NULL operators.

48. What is SQL NOT NULL constraint?
NOT NULL constraint is used to ensure that the value in the filed cannot be a NULL

49. What is a CHECK constraint?
A CHECK constraint is used to limit the value that is accepted by one or more columns.

E.g. 'Age' field should contain only the value greater than 18.

<table class="crayon-table" style=""><tbody><tr class="crayon-row"><td class="crayon-nums " data-settings="show"><div class="crayon-nums-content" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important;"><div class="crayon-num" data-line="crayon-5cba5e6c8087f242340876-1">1</div></div></td><td class="crayon-code"><div class="crayon-pre" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important; -moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4;"><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5cba5e6c8087f242340876-1"><span class="crayon-e">CREATE </span><span class="crayon-e">TABLE </span><span class="crayon-e">EMP_DETAILS</span><span class="crayon-sy">(</span><span class="crayon-e">EmpID </span><span class="crayon-t">int</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-st">NOT</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-t">NULL</span><span class="crayon-sy">,</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">NAME </span><span class="crayon-e">VARCHAR</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-sy">(</span><span class="crayon-cn">30</span><span class="crayon-sy">)</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-st">NOT</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-t">NULL</span><span class="crayon-sy">,</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">Age </span><span class="crayon-t">INT</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">CHECK</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-sy">(</span><span class="crayon-v">AGE</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-o">&amp;</span><span class="crayon-v">gt</span><span class="crayon-sy">;</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-cn">18</span><span class="crayon-sy">)</span><span class="crayon-sy">,</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">PRIMARY </span><span class="crayon-e">KEY</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-sy">(</span><span class="crayon-v">EmpID</span><span class="crayon-sy">)</span><span class="crayon-sy">)</span><span class="crayon-sy">;</span></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

50. What is a DEFAULT constraint?
DEFAULT constraint is used to include a default value in a column when no value is supplied at the time of inserting a record.

51. What is Normalization?
Normalization is the process of table design to minimize the data redundancy.

52. What are all the different Normalization? 
There are different types of Normalization forms in SQL.

First Normal Form (1NF)
Second Normal Form (2NF)
Third Normal Form (3NF)
Boyce and Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
53. What is Denormalization?
Denormalization is a database optimization technique used to increase the performance of a database infrastructure. 
It involves in the process of adding redundant data to one or more tables. In a normalized database, we store data in 
separate logical tables and attempt to minimize redundant data.

54. What is Stored procedure?
A Stored Procedure is a collection of SQL statements that have been created and stored in the database to perform a 
particular task. The stored procedure accepts input parameters and processes them and returns a single value such as a 
number or text value or a result set (set of rows).

55. What is a Trigger?
A Trigger is a SQL procedure that initiates an action in response to an event (Insert, Delete or Update) occurs. When a 
new Employee is added to an Employee_Details table, new records will be created in the relevant tables such as Employee_Payroll, 
Employee_Time_Sheet etc.,

56. Explain SQL Data Types?
In SQL Server, each column in a database table has a name and a data type. We need to decide what type of data to store 
inside each and every column of a table while creating a SQL table.

57. What are the possible values that can be stored in a BOOLEAN data field?
TRUE and FALSE

58. What is the largest value that can be stored in a BYTE data field?
The largest number that can be represented in a single byte is 11111111 or 255. The number of possible values is 256 (i.e. 
255 (the largest possible value) plus 1 (zero), or 28).

59. What are Operators available in SQL?
SQL Operator is a reserved word used primarily in an SQL statement's WHERE clause to perform operations, such as 
arithmetic operations and comparisons. These are used to specify conditions in an SQL statement.

There are three types of Operators.

Arithmetic Operators
Comparison Operators
Logical Operators

60. Which TCP/IP port does SQL Server run?
By default, it is 1433

61. List out the ACID properties and explain? 
Following are the four properties of ACID. These guarantees that the database transactions are processed reliably.

Atomicity
Consistency
Isolation
Durability
62. Define the SELECT INTO statement.
The SELECT INTO statement copies data from one table into a new table. The new table will be created with the column-names 
and types as defined in the old table. You can create new column names using the AS clause.

<table class="crayon-table" style=""><tbody><tr class="crayon-row"><td class="crayon-nums " data-settings="show"><div class="crayon-nums-content" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important;"><div class="crayon-num" data-line="crayon-5cba5e6c80884847843905-1">1</div></div></td><td class="crayon-code"><div class="crayon-pre" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important; -moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4;"><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5cba5e6c80884847843905-1"><span class="crayon-e ">SELECT *</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">INTO </span><span class="crayon-e">newtable </span><span class="crayon-e">FROM </span><span class="crayon-e">oldtable </span><span class="crayon-e">WHERE </span><span class="crayon-v">condition</span><span class="crayon-sy">;</span></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

63. What is the difference between Delete, Truncate and Drop command?
The difference between the Delete, Truncate and Drop command is

Delete command is a DML command, it is used to delete rows from a table. It can be rolled back.
Truncate is a DDL command, it is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table. It 
cant be rolled back.
Drop is a DDL command, it removes the complete data along with the table structure(unlike truncate command that removes only 
the rows). All the tables' rows, indexes, and privileges will also be removed.
64. What is the difference between Delete and Truncate?
The difference between the Delete, and Truncate are

<table id="tablepress-17" class="tablepress tablepress-id-17"><thead><tr class="row-1 odd"><th class="column-1">DELETE</th><th class="column-2">TRUNCATE</th></tr></thead><tbody class="row-hover"><tr class="row-2 even"><td class="column-1">Delete statement is used to delete rows from a table. It can be rolled back.</td><td class="column-2">Truncate statement is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table. It cant be rolled back.</td></tr><tr class="row-3 odd"><td class="column-1">We can use WHERE condition in DELETE statement and can delete required rows</td><td class="column-2">We cant use WHERE condition in TRUNCATE statement. So we cant delete required rows alone</td></tr><tr class="row-4 even"><td class="column-1">We can delete specific rows using DELETE</td><td class="column-2">We can only delete all the rows at a time using TRUNCATE</td></tr><tr class="row-5 odd"><td class="column-1">Delete is a DML command</td><td class="column-2">Truncate is a DDL command</td></tr><tr class="row-6 even"><td class="column-1">Delete maintains log and performance is slower than Truncate</td><td class="column-2">Truncate maintains minimal log and performance wise faster</td></tr><tr class="row-7 odd"><td class="column-1">We need DELETE permission on Table to use DELETE command</td><td class="column-2">We need at least ALTER permission on the table to use TRUNCATE command</td></tr></tbody></table>

65. What is the difference between Union and Union All command?
This is one of the tricky SQL Interview Questions. Interviewer may ask you this question in another way as what are the advantages 
of Union All over Union.

Both Union and Union All concatenate the result of two tables but the way these two queries handle duplicates are different.

Union: It omits duplicate records and returns only distinct result set of two or more select statements.
Union All: It returns all the rows including duplicates in the result set of different select statements.

Performance wise Union All is faster than Union, Since Union All doesn't remove duplicates. Union query checks the duplicate 
values which consumes some time to remove the duplicate records.

Assume: Table1 has 10 records, Table2 has 10 records. Last record from both the tables are same.

If you run Union query.

<table class="crayon-table" style=""><tbody><tr class="crayon-row"><td class="crayon-nums " data-settings="show"><div class="crayon-nums-content" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important;"><div class="crayon-num" data-line="crayon-5cba5e6c8088a375437131-1">1</div><div class="crayon-num crayon-striped-num" data-line="crayon-5cba5e6c8088a375437131-2">2</div><div class="crayon-num" data-line="crayon-5cba5e6c8088a375437131-3">3</div></div></td><td class="crayon-code"><div class="crayon-pre" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important; -moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4;"><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5cba5e6c8088a375437131-1"><span class="crayon-e ">SELECT *</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">FROM </span><span class="crayon-e">Table1</span></div><div class="crayon-line crayon-striped-line" id="crayon-5cba5e6c8088a375437131-2"><span class="crayon-e">UNION</span></div><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5cba5e6c8088a375437131-3"><span class="crayon-e ">SELECT *</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">FROM </span><span class="crayon-v">Table2</span></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

Output: Total 19 records

If you run Union query.

<table class="crayon-table" style=""><tbody><tr class="crayon-row"><td class="crayon-nums " data-settings="show"><div class="crayon-nums-content" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important;"><div class="crayon-num" data-line="crayon-5cba5e6c8088f340331741-1">1</div><div class="crayon-num crayon-striped-num" data-line="crayon-5cba5e6c8088f340331741-2">2</div><div class="crayon-num" data-line="crayon-5cba5e6c8088f340331741-3">3</div></div></td><td class="crayon-code"><div class="crayon-pre" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important; -moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4;"><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5cba5e6c8088f340331741-1"><span class="crayon-e ">SELECT *</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">FROM </span><span class="crayon-e">Table1</span></div><div class="crayon-line crayon-striped-line" id="crayon-5cba5e6c8088f340331741-2"><span class="crayon-e">UNION </span><span class="crayon-e">ALL</span></div><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5cba5e6c8088f340331741-3"><span class="crayon-e ">SELECT *</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">FROM </span><span class="crayon-v">Table2</span></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

Output: Total 20 records

Data type of all the columns in the two tables should be same.

66. What is CLAUSE in SQL?
SQL CLAUSE helps to limit the result set by providing a condition to an SQL Query. A CLAUSE helps to filter the rows from the 
entire set of records. SQL CLAUSES are WHERE & HAVING.

67. What is the difference between Having and Where clause?
Where clause is used to fetch data from a database that specifies particular criteria whereas a Having clause is used along 
with 'GROUP BY' to fetch data that meets particular criteria specified by the Aggregate functions. Where clause cannot be used 
with Aggregate functions, but the Having clause can.

68. What are aggregate functions in SQL?
SQL aggregate functions return a single value, calculated from values in a column. Some of the aggregate functions in SQL 
are as follows

AVG() - This function returns the average value

69. What are string functions in SQL?
SQL string functions are used primarily for string manipulation. Some of the widely used SQL string functions are

LEN() - It returns the length of the value in a text field
LOWER() - It converts character data to lower case
UPPER() - It converts character data to upper case
SUBSTRING() - It extracts characters from a text field
LTRIM() - It is to remove all whitespace from the beginning of the string
RTRIM() - It is to remove all whitespace at the end of the string
CONCAT() - Concatenate function combines multiple character strings together
REPLACE() -  To update the content of a string.

70. What are user defined functions?
As the name suggests these are written by users as per their requirement. User-defined functions are the functions written 
to use a logic whenever required.

71. What are all types of user-defined functions?
There are three types of user-defined function, namely
. Scalar Functions
. Inline Table-valued functions
. Multi-statement valued functions

Scalar functions return unit, variant defined the return clause.
Inline Table-valued functions and Multi-statement valued functions return table as a return.

72. What is Self-Join?
A self-join is a join in which a table is joined with itself, especially when the table has a Foreign Key which references 
its own Primary Key.

73. What is Cross-Join?
Cross join produces a result set which is the number of rows in the first table multiplied by a number of rows in the 
second table if no WHERE clause is used along with Cross join. This kind of result is known as Cartesian Product. If 
suppose, Where clause is used in cross join then the query will work like an Inner join.

74. What is Collation?
Collation is defined as a set of rules that determine how character data can be sorted as well as compared. Character 
data is sorted using rules that define the correct character sequence along with options for specifying case-sensitivity, 
character width, accent marks, kana character types.

75. What are all different types of collation sensitivity?
Different types of collation sensitivity are as follows
Case Sensitivity: A and a and B and b.
Kana Sensitivity: Japanese Kana characters.
Width Sensitivity: Single byte character and double byte character.
Accent Sensitivity.

This query returns "False". In the above question, we could see null = null is not the proper way to compare a null value. 
To compare a value with null, we use IS operator in SQL.

So the correct way is as follows

By using the below syntax we could achieve the output as required.

<table class="crayon-table" style=""><tbody><tr class="crayon-row"><td class="crayon-nums " data-settings="show"><div class="crayon-nums-content" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important;"><div class="crayon-num" data-line="crayon-5cba5e6c808ef357221414-1">1</div></div></td><td class="crayon-code"><div class="crayon-pre" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important; -moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4;"><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5cba5e6c808ef357221414-1"><span class="crayon-e">UPDATE </span><span class="crayon-e">TestTable </span><span class="crayon-e">SET </span><span class="crayon-v">Gender</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-o">=</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-st">CASE</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">Gender </span><span class="crayon-i">WHEN</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-s">'F'</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-st">THEN</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-s">'M'</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-st">ELSE</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-s">'F'</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-st">END</span></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

101. Describe SQL comments?
Single Line Comments: Single line comments start with two consecutive hyphens (-) and ended by the end of the line
Multi-Line Comments: Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */. Any text between /* and */ will be ignored.

102. What is the difference between NVL function, IFNULL function, and ISNULL function?
These three functions work in the same way. These functions are used to replace NULL value with another value. Oracle 
developers use NVL function, MySQL developers use IFNULL function and SQL Server developers use ISNULL function.
Assume, some of the values in a column are NULL.
If you run below statement, you will get result as NULL

<table class="crayon-table" style=""><tbody><tr class="crayon-row"><td class="crayon-nums " data-settings="show"><div class="crayon-nums-content" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important;"><div class="crayon-num" data-line="crayon-5cba5e6c808f2548504674-1">1</div></div></td><td class="crayon-code"><div class="crayon-pre" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important; -moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4;"><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5cba5e6c808f2548504674-1"><span class="crayon-e">SELECT </span><span class="crayon-e ">col1 *</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-sy">(</span><span class="crayon-v">col2</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-o">+</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-v">col3</span><span class="crayon-sy">)</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">FROM </span><span class="crayon-v">Table1</span></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>


Suppose any of the value in col3 is NULL then as I said your result will be NULL.

To overcome this we use NVL() function, IFNULL() function, ISNULL() Function.

103. What is Database Testing?
It is AKA back-end testing or data testing.
Database testing involves in verifying the integrity of data in the front end with the data present in the back end. 
It validates the schema, database tables, columns, indexes, stored procedures, triggers, data duplication, orphan records, 
junk records. It involves in updating records in a database and verifying the same on the front end.

104. What is the difference between GUI Testing and Database Testing?

GUI Testing is AKA User Interface Testing or Front-end testing
Database Testing is AKA back-end testing or data testing.
GUI Testing deals with all the testable items that are open to the user to interaction such as Menus, Forms etc.
Database Testing deals with all the testable items that are generally hidden from the user.
The tester who is performing GUI Testing doesn't need to know Structured Query Language
The tester who is performing Database Testing needs to know Structured Query Language
GUI Testing includes invalidating the text boxes, check boxes, buttons, drop-downs, forms etc., majorly the look and feel 
of the overall application
Database Testing involves in verifying the integrity of data in the front end with the data present in the back end. It 
validates the schema, database tables, columns, indexes, stored procedures, triggers, data duplication, orphan records,

Questions", if you find that we missed some important SQL Server Interview Questions, please comment below we would try to 
include those with answers.

Note: Most of my readers are asking me to write SQL Interview Questions for testers. If you are a Software QA, there is no 
point of learning separate SQL server query interview questions. This post covers everything for both Developers as well as 
Testers.

Agile Testing Interview Questions:

Agile Testing Interview Questions 1 - 10:

1. What is Agile Testing?

Agile testing is a software testing practice that follows the principles of agile software development. It is an iterative 
software development methodology where requirements keep changing as per the customer needs.  Testing is done in parallel 
to the development of an iterative model. Test team receives frequent code changes from the development team for testing an 
application.

2. What is Agile Manifesto?

Agile manifesto defines 4 key points:

i. Individuals and interactions over process and tools
ii. Working software over comprehensive documentation
iii. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
iv. Responding to change over following a plan

3. What are the principles of Agile Software Development?

1. Highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of business valuable software
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently
4. Business people and developers must work together with transparency on daily basis throughout the project
5. Build projects around motivated individuals
6. The best form of communication is to do face-to-face conversation
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Able to maintain a constant pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
10. Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential
11. Self-organizing teams
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly

4. What are the main roles in Scrum?

Scrum consists of three main roles:

Product Owner: Product Owner usually represents the Client and acts as a point of contact from the Client side. The one who 
prioritizes the list of Product Backlogs which Scrum Team should finish and release.

Scrum Master: Scrum Master acts as a facilitator to the Scrum Development Team. Clarifies the queries and organizes the team 
from distractions and teach the team how to use scrum and also concentrates on Return on Investment (ROI). Responsible for 
managing the sprint.

Scrum Development Team: Developer's, QA's. Who develops the product. Scrum development team decides the effort estimation to 
complete a Product Backlog Item.

Scrum Team: A cross-functional, self-organizing group of dedicated people (Group of Product Owner, Business Analyst, 
Developer's and QA's). Recommended size of a scrum team is 7 plus or minus 2 (i.e, between 5 to 9 members in a team).

5. What approach do you follow when requirements change continuously?

In Agile methodology, change in requirement is possible. It's not like other traditional methodologies where the requirements 
are locked down at the requirement phase. Every team member should be ready to handle the changes in the project.

The team should work closely with the Product Owner to understand the scope of requirement change and to negotiate to keep 
the requirement changes to a minimum or to adopt those changes in the next sprint. Based on the requirement changes Test 
Team could update the Test Plan and Test Cases to achieve the deadlines. The team should understand the risk in the requirement 
change and prepare a contingency plan. It is a best practice not to go for the automation process until requirements are finalized.

6. How is Agile Testing different from other traditional Software Development Models?

It is one of the common Agile Testing Interview Questions.

In Agile Methodology, testing is not a phase like other traditional models. It is an activity parallel to development in the 
Agile. The time slot for the testing is less in the Agile compared to the traditional models. The testing team works on small 
features in Agile whereas the test team works on a complete application after development in the traditional models.

7. In what way does agile development methodology differ from other development methodologies?

In Agile methodology, the code is broken down into small branches and only one branch is developed and tested at a time. At 
one particular time, only one particular branch is developed and tested. Agile teams follow several processes in the agile 
methodology like continuous communication with the team, frequent changes to get the optimal results etc. This makes the 
agile process more flexible and focused. This is not the case with other development methodologies.

8. When do we use Agile Scrum Methodology?

i. When the client is not so clear on requirements
ii. When the client expects quick releases
iii. When the client doesn't give all the requirements at a time

9. What is a Sprint?

In Scrum, the project is divided into Sprints. Each Sprint has a specified timeline (2 weeks to 1 month). This timeline will 
be agreed by a Scrum Team during the Sprint Planning Meeting. Here, User Stories are split into different modules. The end 
result of every Sprint should be a potentially shippable product.

10. What are Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog?

Product Backlog: Product Backlog is a repository where the list of Product Backlog Items stored and maintained by the Product 
Owner. The list of Product Backlog Items are prioritized by the Product Owner as high and low and also could re-prioritize 
the product backlog constantly.

Sprint Backlog: Group of user stories which scrum development team agreed to do during the current sprint (Committed Product 
Backlog items). It is a subset of the product backlog.

11. What is the difference between Burn-up and Burn-down chart?

Burn Down Charts provide proof that the project is on track or not. Both the burn-up and burn-down charts are graphs used to 
track the progress of a project.

Burn-up charts represent how much work has been completed in a project whereas Burn-down chart represents the remaining work 
left in a project.

Agile Testing Interview Questions 11 - 20:

12. What are the types of burn-down charts?

There are four popularly used burn down charts in Agile.

i. Product burndown chart
ii. Sprint burndown chart
iii. Release burndown chart
iv. Defect burndown chart

13. What is Product Burndown Chart?

A graph which shows how many Product Backlog Items (User Stories) implemented/not implemented.

14. What is Sprint Burndown Chart?

A graph which shows how many Sprints implemented/not implemented by the Scrum Team.

15. What is Release Burndown Chart?

A graph which shows List of releases still pending, which Scrum Team have planned.

16. What is Defect Burndown Chart?

A graph which shows how many defects identified and fixed.

17. What is a Daily Stand-up Meeting?

Daily Stand-up Meeting is a daily routine meeting. It brings everyone up to date on the information and helps the team to 
stay organized.
Each team member reports to the peers the following:

What did you complete yesterday?
Any impediments in your way?
What do you commit to today?
When do you think you will be done with that?
In general, it's not a recorded meeting. Reporting will be between peers not to Scrum Master or Product Owner. It is 
normally timeboxed to a maximum of 15 minutes. It is aka 15 Minute Stand-up Meeting.

18. What is a Sprint Planning Meeting?

The first step of Scrum is the Sprint Planning Meeting where the entire Scrum Team attends. Here the Product Owner 
selects the Product Backlog Items (User Stories) from the Product Backlog.
Most important User Stories at the top of the list and least important User Stories at the bottom. Scrum Development 
Team decides and provides effort estimation.

19. What is a Sprint Review Meeting?

In the Sprint Review Meeting, Scrum Development Team presents a demonstration of a potentially shippable product. 
Product Owner declares which items are completed and not completed. Product Owner adds the additional items to the 
product backlog based on the stakeholder's feedback.

20. What is a Sprint Retrospective Meeting?

Scrum Team meets again after the Sprint Review Meeting and documents the lessons learned in the earlier sprint such 
as "What went well", "What could be improved". It helps the Scrum Team to avoid the mistakes in the next Sprints.

21. What is a Task Board?

A task board is a dashboard which illustrates the progress that an agile team is making in achieving their sprint goals.

In general, the columns used in a task board are as follows

i. User Story: Actual Business Requirement (Description)
ii. To Do: All the tasks of current sprint
iii. In Progress: Any task being worked on
iv. To Verify: Tasks pending for verification
v. Done: Tasks which are completed

22. What is DevOps?

The term DevOps was formed by combining "Development" and "Operations". DevOps is an operational philosophy that 
promotes collaboration between development and operation teams. DevOps focuses on bringing development and operations 
team together in order to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.

23. What is the difference between Agile and DevOps?

25. How long were your sprints?

An ideal sprint length is anywhere between 1 week to 4 weeks. 2 week-long Sprints are most common for IT and software 
product development.

26. What are the disadvantages of the agile model?

Some of the disadvantages of using the agile model are as follows:

It is not easy to predict. When you encounter a large project, it becomes more problematic to estimate the amount of effort 
needed in the project
In case the guidelines given by the customers is not understood properly, then the final outcome of the project will not meet 
the customer requirements. It leads to the customer dissatisfaction
It is not possible to properly focus on the design and documentation of a project sometimes
Basically, High-level decision making is in the hands of the higher authorities. The team members with little or no experience 
are not involved in decision-making, thus they don't get a chance to advance their knowledge
27. What is an impediment in Scrum? 

Impediments are the obstacles faced by the scrum team. Any obstacle that keeps the team from getting work done and that slows 
velocity is known as Impediment. Scrum Master is responsible for removing impediments.

In Agile Scrum interviews, you may be asked to give some examples of impediments.

28. What are the examples of impediments?

Impediments come in many forms. Some of the impediments are mentioned below

Resource unavailability (Sick team member)
Lack of management support
Business issues
Lack of skill
Technical, operational issues
Even external issues such as weather
29. What kind of impediments should a scrum master remove?

Scrum Master's main responsibility is to identify, track and help remove impediments. Scrum Master shouldn't remove impediments 
initially even though Scrum Master can remove impediments on behalf of the Scrum team. The Scrum Master should not pamper nor 
overrule the Scrum Team. Scrum Master should motivate the Scrum team to become independent enough to face problems and take a 
decision and perform every task by themselves. The Scrum team should be able to make their own decisions. The Scrum master 
supports and guides the Scrum Team to operate as efficiently as possible. Sometimes, impediments are beyond the ability of 
the Scrum Team to remove. In such cases, the Scrum Master may get support from outside of the Scrum Team.

30. What is Velocity?

Velocity is a key metric that is calculated at the end of each sprint by addition of all effort estimates associated with 
user stories completed in a sprint. It predicts how much work an agile software development team can successfully complete 
within a sprint and how much time will it need to finish a project. Points from partially-completed or incomplete user 
stories should not be counted in calculating velocity.












<b id="Real Time Software QA Interview Questions And Answers | SoftwareTestingMaterial:">Real Time Software QA Interview Questions And Answers | SoftwareTestingMaterial:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>


These Software QA Interview Questions and Answers were prepared with our real-time experience. These QA Job Interview questions are for beginners, intermediate and advanced level. 

Let's get started with these top 30+ QA Job interview questions for Quality Analysts / Test Engineers.

1. What is the difference between Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC)?

Quality Assurance: Quality Assurance involves in process-oriented activities. It ensures the prevention of defects in the process used to make Software Application. 
So the defects don't arise when the Software Application is being developed.

Quality Control: Quality Control involves in product-oriented activities. It executes the program or code to identify the defects in the Software Application.


2. What is the difference between Preventative and Reactive approaches in testing?

Preventive approach: It is also known as Verification Process. This approach is to prevent defects. In this approach, 
tests are designed at early stages of SDLC i.e., before the software has been produced. Here in this approach testers 
try to prevent defects in the early stages. It comes under Quality Analysis (QA).


Reactive approach: It is also known as Validation Process. This approach is to identify defects. In this approach, 
tests are designed to execute after the software has been produced. Here we try to find defects. It comes under Quality Control (QC).


3. Why are you in QA?

I am in QA because I like this job.


4. List out the roles of Quality Assurance engineer?

A software quality assurance engineer usually involves in the following tasks.

QA Team is responsible to monitor the entire development process.
They are responsible to track the outcomes of each phase of SDLC and adjust them to meet the expectation.
They are responsible to read and understand the requirement documents.
Analyze test requirements, and design and execute tests.
Develop test cases and prioritize testing activities.
Record problems and issues in accordance with the project's problem and issue management plans.
Work with the application team and/or client to resolve any issues that arise in the testing process.
Carry out regression testing every time when changes are made to the code to fix defects.
Have to interact with the clients to better understand the product requirements.
Participate in walkthroughs of testing procedures.

5. Explain the process of QA testing?

In simple words, QA testing process is a step by step process which involves analyzing requirement documents, preparing test strategy, 
test plan and test cases, executing test cases when the build is ready. In the execution process QA's perform different types of 
testing to make sure the software reaches or exceeds the expectation.


6. What is the role of documentation in QA?

Documentation plays a vital role in Quality Assurance. All the documents involved in SDLC such as Business Requirement Specifications, 
Designs, Inspection reports, Configurations, Code changes, Test Strategy, Test plans, Test cases, Bug reports, User manuals should be documented.

Documentation helps us to achieve high quality software product.
Documentation is necessary to make things more real
We could use documentation as a reference material and reuse it when necessary
We could save lot of organization's time, effort and money by maintaining proper documentation.
Proper documentation makes easy for the client to review the software process.

7. What is quality audit?

Quality audit is the process of systematic and independent examination of a software product or process to assess compliance with specifications,
 standards, agreements and other relevant criteria.

8. Mention what are the test artifacts involved in QA?

The test artifacts involved in QA are Test Strategy, Test Plan, Test Scenarios, Test Cases, Test Summary Report, Bug Report etc.,


9. Have you written Test Strategy?

Usually, test strategy document will be prepared by Test Managers or Project Managers. If you are applying for a Project Manger position and 
you have experience in preparing Test Strategy document then you can say Yes else say I know what is a test strategy and its purpose but I 
never got a chance to write Test Strategy document.

10. What is a Test Strategy and what does it include?

Test Strategy is a high level document (static document) and usually developed by project manager. It is a document which captures the approach 
on how we go about testing the product and achieve the goals. It is normally derived from the Business Requirement Specification (BRS). 
Documents like Test Plan are prepared by keeping this document as base.

11. Have you written Test Plan?

Usually, test plan document will be prepared by Test Leads or Test Managers. If you are applying for a Test lead position and you have 
experience in preparing Test Plan document then you can say Yes else say I know what is a test plan and its purpose but I never got a chance to write Test Strategy document.


12. What is a Test Plan and what does it include?

Test plan document is a document which contains the plan for all the testing activities to be done to deliver a quality product. Test Plan document 
is derived from the Product Description, SRS, or Use Case documents for all future activities of the project. It is usually prepared by the Test Lead 
or Test Manager and the focus of the document is to describe what to test, what not to test, how to test when to test and who will do what test. Also, 
it includes the environment and tools needed, resource allocation, test technique to be followed, risks and contingencies plan. A test plan is a dynamic 
document and we should always keep it up-to-date. Test plan document guides us how the testing activity should go on. Success of the testing project completely depends on Test Plan.


13. What is a Test case template?
	A test case template is a document comes under one of the test artifacts, which allows testers to develop the test cases for a particular test scenario in order to 
verify whether the features of an application are working as intended or not. Test cases are the set of positive and negative executable steps of a test scenario 
which has a set of pre-conditions, test data, expected result, post-conditions and actual results. Most of the companies are using test case management tools such 
as Quality Center (HP QC), JIRA etc., and some of the companies still using excel sheets to write test cases.

14. What are the key components of a test case template

The key components of a test case template are Project name, Module name, Created by, Date of creation, reviewed by, date of review, executed by, Date of execution,
 test scenario, tase case id, test case description, Precondition, Test steps, Test data, expected result, post condition, actual result, status of the bug.
 
 
 15. How do you decide when you have tested enough?
This is one of the most important questions in terms of ISTQB. Option will be tricky and you have to choose the right one.
As a project manager or project lead, sometimes you might face a situation to call off the testing to release the product early. 
In those cases, you have to decide whether the testers have tested the product enough or not.
There are many factors involved in the real time projects to decide when to stop testing.

if we reach Testing deadlines or release deadlines
By reaching the decided pass percentage of test cases
if the risk in the project is under the acceptable limit
if All the high priority bugs and blockers are fixed
if we met the acceptance criteria
As per ISTQB, It depends on the risks for the system being tested.


16. What are the key components of a bug report?

Bug report is aka defect report, it conveys the detailed information (such as environment details, steps to reproduce etc.,) about the bug to the developers. 
It allows developers to replicate the bug easily. The key components of a bug report are Defect Id, title of the defect, Reporter Name, Defect Report Date, 
Reporter designation, Project name, Release Version, Environment details, Priority of the bug, Severity of the bug, Status of the bug, Defect Description, 
Steps to reproduce the bug, Expected result, Actual result, Attachments if any and Defect closed date.


17. Tell me some key points to consider while writing a bug report. 

i. Reproduce the bug 2-3 times.
ii. Use some keywords related to your bug and search in the Defect Tracking Tool.
iii. Check in similar modules.
iv. Report the problem immediately.
v. Write detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
vi. Write a good defect summary. Watch your language in the process of writing the bug report, your words should not offend people. 
Never use capital letter whilst explaining the issue.
vii. Advisable to Illustrate the issue by using proper screenshots.
viii. Proofread your bug report twice or thrice before posting it.


18. What are the advantage and disadvantages of Automated Testing?

Advantages:

Automation testing is faster in execution
It is cheaper compared to manual testing in a long run
Automated testing is more reliable
Automated testing is more powerful and versatile
It is mostly used for regression testing
It does not require human intervention. Test scripts can be run unattended
It helps to increase the test coverage
Disadvantages:

It is recommended only for stable products
Automation testing is expensive initially
Most of the automation tools are expensive
It has some limitations such as handling captcha, fonts, color
Huge maintenance in case of repeated changes in the requirements
Not all the tools support all kinds of testing. Such as windows, web, mobility, performance/load testing

19. What is the difference between build and release?

Build: A build is a version of a software. Every build has a number for identification purpose. Build is a pre-release version of a Release. 
Build is given to testing team by developers to test the application locally. Build numbers are incremental.

Release: A release is the distribution of the final version of an application to the customer by software development team.

20. What is bug leakage and bug release?

Bug Leakage: A bug which is actually missed by the testing team while testing and the build was released to the Production. If now that bug 
(which was missed by the testing team) was found by the end user or customer then we call it as Bug Leakage.

Bug release: Releasing the software to the Production with some known bugs then we call it as Bug Release. These known bugs should be included 
in the release note. In other case, releasing the software to the testing team with some known bugs whose severity and priority is low. These 
bugs can be removed before releasing to production.

21. What is Bug triage?

Bug triage is a formal process to find which bugs are important by prioritizing them based on their severity, frequency, risk and other 
important parameters. Testers assign priority (high, medium, low) to each and every bug in a bug triage meeting and based on the priority those 
bugs will be fixed in an order. By doing this we could save a lot of organization's time.

22. Explain bug life cycle.

Bug life cycle is also known as Defect life cycle. In Software Development process, the bug has a life cycle. The bug should go through the 
life cycle to be closed. Bug life cycle varies depends upon the tools (QC, JIRA etc.,) used and the process followed in the organization.


23. What is MR and ER?

MR: MR stands for Modification Request. It is used to change the existing functionality in a software, it is usually requested by clients.

ER: ER stands for Enhancement report. It is used to add a new feature in a software. It is usually requested by clients.

24. Mention some of the types of software testing?

There are more than 100 types of software testing.


25. What is CRUD testing?

CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) is another term used for Black box testing. CRUD testing is another term for database testing.


C - Create - Creating a new Transaction
R - Read/Retrieve - Searching or viewing a transaction
U - Update - Editing or modifying an existing transaction.
D - Delete - Deleting a transaction from the database


26. What is a Cookie testing?

A Cookie is also known as HTTP cookie, web cookie, internet cookie, browser cookie.


27. What is Cross browser testing?

Cross Browser Testing is a type of non-functional test which helps us ensure that our website or web application works as expected in various web browsers.
 We could do Cross Browser Testing on different browsers both manual and automated way. To do Cross Browser Testing manually, we (Software Testers) create
 tests for each browser and execute it manually on each browser. To do it in an automated way, we could create Selenium tests with multiple conditional 
 statements that execute test cases based on specified browser type. Every browser displays a website in their own style. We usually cannot have all the
 browsers on one machine. Each browser is designed by a different vendor. So each browser has their own features to showcase their unique presence. While
 testing a website, we need to ensure that our website is appearing same across all the browsers. To do this we need to have all the browsers. Fortunately,
 there are some tools to perform cross-browser testing without testing individually in a manual way.
 
 
 
 28. What is the difference between Compatibility testing and Cross browser testing?

Compatibility testing: Testing an application on different hardware or software platform is Compatibility testing.
Example: Different devices such as iPhone, Samsung etc., Different operating system such as Windows, Linux etc.,

Cross browser testing: Testing a web application on different browsers is Cross browser testing. Cross browser testing is a subset of Compatibility testing.
Example: Google Chrome, IE 10, IE 11, Firefox 43 etc.,

29. What is Configuration management?

Configuration management is a process followed during the project life cycle to control and document each and every change.

30. What are the various tools you have used in testing process?

The tools which I have used during testing process are as follows.

Test Management Tools: JIRA, TestLodge, Quality Center
Test Case Management Tools: TestCaseLab
Defect Tracking Tools: Bugzilla, MantisBT
Automation Tools: QTP/UFT, Selenium, LoadRunner
GUI Tools: Froglogic Squish
Cross Browser Testing Tools: CrossBrowserTesting, BrowserStack

<b id="30+ Database Testing Interview Questions And Answers:">30+ Database Testing Interview Questions And Answers:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

We have designed most popular Database Testing Interview Questions And Answers for Experienced as well as Freshers. In this post, you can find Advanced 
Database testing interview questions for experienced and Database testing interview questions for freshers.

1. What is a Database?

A database is a collection of information in an organized form for faster and better access, storage and manipulation. It can also be defined as a 
collection of tables, schema, views and other database objects.

2. What is Database Testing?

It is AKA back-end testing or data testing.
Database testing involves in verifying the integrity of data in the front end with the data present in the back end. It validates the schema, database 
tables, columns, indexes, stored procedures, triggers, data duplication, orphan records, junk records. It involves in updating records in a database 
and verifying the same on the front end.

Database testing includes the following:

Data validity testing
Data integrity testing
Database performance testing
Testing of procedures, triggers and functions

3. What are the different types of Database Testing?

DB Testing can be categorized into 3 categories based on the functions and structure of a database.

Structural Database Testing
Functional Database Testing
Non-functional Database Testing

4. What are the challenges you faced while performing database testing?

This is one of the popular interview questions on Database Testing.

Some of the challenges are as follows:

Scope of the testing is large
Scaled down test database
Changes in database structure
Complex test plans
Good understanding of SQL

5. What is the process of database testing?

The process of database testing is as follows:

Setting up an environment
Run a test
Verify test results
Validate actual results and expected results
Report it to the reporting head

6. What do we usually check in database testing?

In database testing, we usually check the following

Field size validation
Check constraints
Check Stored procedures
Check indexes in terms of verifying performance related issues
Check the field size defined in the application is matching with that in the database

7. What is data driven test?

Data driven testing is used in the process of testing where we want to pass multiple test data. Generally, we pass different sets of data 
in our scripts instead of passing hard coded values each time. It helps us to verify the efficiency of the application in handling different inputs.

8. What are the types of data driven testing?

Types of data driven testing are as follows:

Data driven tests through flat files (.txt, .docx)
Data driven tests through front end objects (list, menu, etc.,)
Data driven tests through excel sheets or database (.xlsx, .db)
Data driven tests by keying (through keyboard)

9. What are the steps need to be taken while testing Stored Procedures?

Step 1: In a testing perspective, first we need to understand the requirement of a particular stored procedure.

Step 2: Check whether all the required indexes, updates, deletions, joins are correctly specified in comparing with tables mentioned in the Stored Procedure.

Step 3: Check the procedure calling name, calling parameters and expected responses for different sets of input parameters.

Step 4: Use the database client programs like TOAD, MySQL, or Query Analyzer to run the procedures.

Step 5: Rerun the procedures by passing different parameters and verify the results against expected values.

Step 6: Finally, automate the tests using automation tool.

10. What is a trigger? How do you verify if a trigger is fired or not?

A Trigger is a SQL procedure that initiates an action in response to an event (Insert, Delete or Update) occurs. When a new Employee is added 
to an Employee_Details table, new records will be created in the relevant tables such as Employee_Payroll, Employee_Time_Sheet etc.,

Triggers in SQL are used to maintain the integrity of the data present in the database. By querying the common audit logs, we can verify whether 
a trigger is fired or not.

11. How do you verify whether a database is updated when passing the data through front end?

Blackbox testers usually verify whether the data is available or not in the frontend by going through reports or some other screen where the data can be viewable.

If there is no page in the front end to view the data, then there is an option to verify the data in the back end by running SQL queries.

12. What are the steps to test data loading in database testing?

Steps to test data loading in database testing are as follows

Get Source database
Get Target database
Compatibility between source and destination database should be checked
Run the DTS package in the corresponding DTS package
Compare the columns of source and target database
Verify the number of rows of source and target database
Verify whether the changes have been reflected on target database after updating data in the source.
Verify null values and junk characters

13. What are the necessary things needed for writing database test cases?

To write database test cases, you need to have knowledge on following First step to do this is to know the functional requirement of the application

Next step is to check back end database tables, joins, cursors, triggers, stored procedures, input and output parameters.

14. How to test database manually?

Testing database manually involves verifying the data entered in the front end is available in the back end or not. The same verification 
process applies for delete, update, insert etc.,

15. How to test procedures and triggers of a database?

To test procedures and triggers of database, we need to have knowledge on input and output parameters. EXEC statement is helpful to run the 
procedure and examine the behavior of the tables.

Let's see how to test procedures and triggers of a database

Open database project in solution explorer
Go to view, Click on database schema
Open the project folder from the schema view menu
Right click on the object that has to be testing and click on the dialog box say Create Unit Tests
Create a new language test project
Choose insert the unit test or create a new test and then click OK
Project that has to be configured will be done by clicking on the Project Configuration dialog box
Finally, configure the project and click on OK

16. What is a View?

A view is like a subset of a table which is stored logically in a database. A view is a virtual table. It contains rows and columns similar
 to a real table. The fields in the view are fields from one or more real tables. Views do not contain data of their own. They are used to 
 restrict access to the database or to hide data complexity.
 
 
 <div class="crayon-pre" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important; -moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4;"><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5df46762023d2876996743-1"><span class="crayon-e">CREATE </span><span class="crayon-e">VIEW </span><span class="crayon-e">view_name </span><span class="crayon-st">AS</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">SELECT </span><span class="crayon-i">column_name1</span><span class="crayon-sy">,</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">column_name2 </span><span class="crayon-e">FROM </span><span class="crayon-e">table_name </span><span class="crayon-e">WHERE </span><span class="crayon-i">CONDITION</span><span class="crayon-sy">;</span></div></div>
 
 
 17. What are the advantages of Views?

Some of the advantages of Views are

Views occupy no space
Views are used to simply retrieve the results of complicated queries that need to be executed often
Views are used to restrict access to the database or to hide data complexity

18. What is Normalization?

Normalization is the process of table design to minimize the data redundancy. There are different types of Noramalization forms in SQL.

First Normal Form
Second Normal Form
Third Normal Form
Boyce and Codd Normal Form

19. What is a Join?

Join is a query, which retrieves related columns or rows from multiple tables.

20. What are the different types of joins?

Types of Joins are as follows:

INNER JOIN
LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
OUTER JOIN

21. What is an Index?

An index is used to speed up the performance of queries. It makes faster retrieval of data from the table. The index can be created on one column or a group of columns.

22. What are the different types of indexes?

Different types of indexes are as follows

B-Tree index
Bitmap index
Clustered index
Covering index
Non-unique index
Unique index

23. What is DBMS?

Database Management System is a collection of programs that enables a user to store, retrieve, update and delete information from a database.

24. Which SQL statements can be used in Database Testing?

SQL commands are segregated into following types:

DDL - Data Definition Language
DML - Data Manipulation Language
DQL - Data Query Language
DCL - Data Control Language
TCL - Transaction Control Language


25. What are the different DDL commands in SQL?

DDL commands are used to define or alter the structure of the database.

CREATE: To create databases and database objects
ALTER: To alter existing database objects
DROP: To drop databases and databases objects
TRUNCATE: To remove all records from a table but not its database structure
RENAME: To rename database objects

26. What are the different DML commands in SQL?

DML commands are used for managing data present in the database.

SELECT: To select specific data from a database
INSERT: To insert new records into a table
UPDATE: To update existing records
DELETE: To delete existing records from a table

27. What are the different DCL commands in SQL?

DCL commands are used to create roles, grant permission and control access to the database objects.

GRANT: To provide user access
DENY: To deny permissions to users
REVOKE: To remove user access

28. What are the different TCL commands in SQL?

TCL commands are used to manage the changes made by DML statements.

COMMIT: To write and store the changes to the database
ROLLBACK: To restore the database since the last commit

29. What is RDBMS?

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model. 
Data from relational database can be accessed using Structured Query Language (SQL)

30. What are Operators available in SQL?

SQL Operator is a reserved word used primarily in an SQL statement's WHERE clause to perform operations, such as arithmetic operations and comparisons. 
These are used to specify conditions in an SQL statement.

There are three types of Operators.

Arithmetic Operators
Comparison Operators
Logical Operators



31. What is the difference between Union and Union All command?

This is one of the tricky SQL Interview Questions. Interviewer may ask you this question in another way as what are the advantages of Union All over Union.


Both Union and Union All concatenate the result of two tables but the way these two queries handle duplicates are different.

Union: It omits duplicate records and returns only distinct result set of two or more select statements.
Union All: It returns all the rows including duplicates in the result set of different select statements.

Performance wise Union All is faster than Union, Since Union All doesn't remove duplicates. Union query checks the duplicate values which 
consumes some time to remove the duplicate records.

Assume: Table1 has 10 records, Table2 has 10 records. Last record from both the tables are same.

If you run Union query.


<div class="crayon-pre" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important; -moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4;"><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5df46762023dc265569686-1"><span class="crayon-e ">SELECT *</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">FROM </span><span class="crayon-e">Table1</span></div><div class="crayon-line crayon-striped-line" id="crayon-5df46762023dc265569686-2"><span class="crayon-e">UNION</span></div><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5df46762023dc265569686-3"><span class="crayon-e ">SELECT *</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">FROM </span><span class="crayon-i">Table2</span></div></div>



Output: Total 19 records

If you run Union ALL query.

<div class="crayon-pre" style="font-size: 12px !important; line-height: 15px !important; -moz-tab-size:4; -o-tab-size:4; -webkit-tab-size:4; tab-size:4;"><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5df46762023e3664282715-1"><span class="crayon-e ">SELECT *</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">FROM </span><span class="crayon-e">Table1</span></div><div class="crayon-line crayon-striped-line" id="crayon-5df46762023e3664282715-2"><span class="crayon-e">UNION </span><span class="crayon-e">ALL</span></div><div class="crayon-line" id="crayon-5df46762023e3664282715-3"><span class="crayon-e ">SELECT *</span><span class="crayon-h"> </span><span class="crayon-e">FROM </span><span class="crayon-i">Table2</span></div></div>


Output: Total 20 records

Data type of all the columns in the two tables should be same.

<b id="18 Common SOAP Interview Questions:">18 Common SOAP Interview Questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

In this post, we see SOAP Interview Questions. Before going ahead, let's see some unavoidable Interview Questions which every hiring manager 
asks you in any Software Testing interview.

Let's move with the actual post on SOAP Interview Questions And Answers.

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a technological specification designed to support Web services interface with other systems; 
without it, the Web services are unable to cross operating systems and platforms, and often lack interoperability. Besides REST, SOAP has
 become increasingly popular for developers working on system integration based projects. For such reasons, it would be very useful for 
 both freshers and senior professionals in the field to expand their general knowledge in SOAP API.

 To help you learn more about SOAP under time constraints, either for technical interviews or for a new upcoming role, we have collected a
 comprehensive list related to common SOAP testing interview questions and answers. We do recommend you to spend some time reading through 
 the list to ace the job interviews or well prepare for your new projects.



1. What are SOAP Web services?
SOAP is defined as an XML-based protocol. It is known for designing and developing web services as well as enabling communication between 
applications developed on different platforms using various programming languages over the Internet. It is both platform and language independent.

2. How does SOAP work?
SOAP is used to provide a user interface that can be accessed by the client object, and the request that it sends goes to the server, which 
can be accessed using the server object. The user interface creates some files or methods consisting of server object and the name of the interface
 to the server object. It also contains other information such as the name of the interface and methods. It uses HTTP to send the XML to the server 
 using the POST method, which analyzes the method and sends the result to the client. The server creates more XML consisting of responses to the 
 request of user interface using HTTP. The client can use any approach to send the XML, like the SMTP server or POP3 protocol to pass the messages 
 or reply to queries.

3. When to use SOAP API?
Use the SOAP API to create, retrieve, update or delete records, like accounts, leads, and use-defined objects. With more than 20 different calls,
 you can also use the SOAP API to manage passwords, perform searches, etc. by using the SOAP API in any language that supports web services.

4. How users utilize the facilities provided by SOAP?
PutAddress(): It is used to enter an address in the webpage and has an address instance on the SOAP call.
PutListing(): It is used to allow the insertion of a complete XML document into the web page. It receives the XML file as an argument and transports 
the XML file to XML parser liaison, which reads it and inserts it into the SOAP call as a parameter.
GetAddress(): It is used to get a query name and gets the result that best matches a query. The name is sent to the SOAP call in the form of text 
character string.
GetAllListing(): It is used to return the full list in an XML format.


5. What is the major obstacle users faced when using SOAP?
When using SOAP, users often see the firewall security mechanism as the biggest obstacle. This block all the ports leaving few like HTTP port 80 
and the HTTP port used by SOAP that bypasses the firewall. The technical complaint against SOAP is that it mixes the specification for message 
transport with the specification for message structure.

6. What are the various approaches available for developing SOAP based web services?
There are two different methods available for developing SOAP-based web services, which are explained below:
Contract-first approach: the contract is first defined by XML and WSDL, and then Java classes are derived from the contract.
Contract-last approach: Java classes are first defined, and then the contract is generated, which is normally the WSDL file from the Java class.
"Contract-first" method is the most popular approach.

7. What are the elements of a SOAP message structure?
It is a common XML document that contains the elements as a SOAP message

Envelope: It is an obligatory root element that translates the XML document and defines the beginning and end of the message.
Header: It is an optional item which contains information about the message being sent.
Body: It contains the XML data comprising the message being sent.
Fault: It provides the information on errors that occurred while during message processing.

8. What are the syntax rules for a SOAP message?
Must use encoded XML
Envelope namespace must be used
Encoding namespace must be used
Must not consist of a DTD reference
Must not have XML processing instruction

9. What is the transport method in SOAP?
Application layer and transport layers of a network are used by SOAP; HTTP and SMTP are the valid protocol of the application layer used as the 
transport for SOAP. HTTP is more preferable, since it works well with the current Internet infrastructure, in particular with firewalls.
The SOAP requests can be sent using an HTTP GET method while the specification only contains details about HTTP POST.

10. What are some important characteristics of a SOAP envelope element?
SOAP message has a root Envelope element
Envelope is an obligatory part of the SOAP message.
If an envelope includes a header element, it should not contain more than one.
Envelop version will change if the SOAP version changes.
The SOAP envelope is indicated by the prefix ENV and the envelope element.
The optional SOAP encoding is also specified using a namespace and the optional encoding style element.

11. What are the major functionalities provided by the SOAP protocol class?
The SOAP protocol is used to provide simple access methods for all the applications available on the Internet, providing the following functionalities:

Call: A class which provides the main functionality for a remote method for which a call is needed. It is used to create the call() and to specify 
the encoding style of the registry that will be assigned when if necessary. This call() function is used by the RPC call, which represents the 
options of the call object.
Deployment Descriptor: A class used to provide the information about the SOAP services. It enables easy deployment without the need for other approaches.
DOM2 Writer: A class that serializes and uses DOM node as XML string to provide more functionalities.
RPC Message: A class used as the base class that calls and replies to the request submitted to the server.
Service Manager: A class that provides, lists and then outputs all SOAP services.

12. What are the web relation functionalities provided by SOAP protocol?
HTTPUtils: This provides the functionality of the POST method to safely meet the requirements.
Parameter: It is an argument for a RPC call used by both the client and the server.
Response: It is an object that represents an RPC reply from both client and server, but the result will not be displayed until after the method call.
TCPTunnel: It is an object that provides the ability to listen on a specific port and to forward all the host and port names.
TypeConverter: It helps to convert an object of one type into another type and this is called using the class in the form object.

13. How does the message security model allow the creation of SOAP more secure to use?
The security model includes the given security tokens. These tokens comprise digital signatures for protection and authentication of SOAP messages.
 Security tokens can be used to provide the bond between authentication secrets or keys and security identities. Security token uses the authentication 
 protocols and an X.509 certificate to define the relationship between the public key and identity key. The signatures are used to verify the messages
 and their origin, generate knowledge to confirm the security tokens to bind the identity of a person to the identity of the originator. Security model
 prevents different attacks and can be used to protect the SOAP architecture.

14. What is the difference between top down & bottom up approach in SOAP Web services?
Top down SOAP Web services include creating WSDL document to create a contract between the web service and the client, with a required code as an option.
 This is also known as Contract-first approach. The top-down approach is difficult to implement because classes must be written to confirm the contract 
 defined in WSDL. One of the benefits of this method is that both client and server code can be written in parallel.
Bottom up SOAP web services require the code to be written first and then WSDL is generated. It is also known as Contract-last approach. Since WSDL is 
created based on the code, bottom-up approach is easy to implement and client codes must wait for WSDL from the server side to start working.

15. What are advantages of SOAP?
SOAP is both platform and language independent.
SOAP separates the encoding and communications protocol from the runtime - environment.
Web service can retrieve or receive a SOAP user data from a remote service, and the source's platform information is completely independent of each other.
Everything can generate XML, from Perl scripts through C++ code to J2EE app servers.
It uses XML to send and receive messages.
It uses standard internet HTTP protocol.
SOAP runs over HTTP; it eliminates firewall problems. When protocol HTTP is used as the protocol binding, an RPC call will be automatically assigned to 
an HTTP request, and the RPC response will be assigned to an HTTP reply.
Compared to RMI, CORBA and DCOM, SOAP is very easy to use.
SOAP acts as a protocol to move information in a distributed and decentralized environment.
SOAP is independent of the transport protocol and can be used to coordinate different protocols.

16. What are disadvantages of SOAP?
SOAP is typically significantly slower than other types of middleware standards, including CORBA, because SOAP uses a detailed XML format. A complete
 understanding of the performance limitations before building applications around SOAP is hence required.
SOAP is usually limited to pooling and not to event notifications when HTTP is used for the transport. In addition, only one client can use the services 
of one server in typical situations.
If HTTP is used as the transport protocol, firewall latency usually occurs since the firewall analyzes the HTTP transport. This is because HTTP is also
 leveraged for Web browsing, and so many firewalls do not understand the difference between using HTTP within a web browser and using HTTP within SOAP.
SOAP has different support levels, depending on the supported programming language. For instance, SOAP supported in Python and PHP is not as powerful as 
it is in Java and .NET.

17. SOAP or Rest APIs, which method to use?
SOAP is the heavyweight choice for Web service access. It provides the following advantages when compared to REST:

SOAP is not very easy to implement and requires more bandwidth and resources.
SOAP message request is processed slower as compared to REST and it does not use web caching mechanism.
WS-Security: While SOAP supports SSL (just like REST) it also supports WS-Security which adds some enterprise security features.
WS-AtomicTransaction: Need ACID Transactions over a service, you're going to need SOAP.
WS-ReliableMessaging: If your application needs Asynchronous processing and a guaranteed level of reliability and security. Rest doesn't have a standard 
messaging system and expects clients to deal with communication failures by retrying.
If the security is a major concern and the resources are not limited then we should use SOAP web services. Like if we are creating a web service for payment 
gateways, financial and telecommunication related work, then we should go with SOAP as here high security is needed.
REST is easier to use for the most part and is more flexible. It has the following advantages when compared to SOAP:

Since REST uses standard HTTP, it is much simpler.
REST is easier to implement, requires less bandwidth and resources.
REST permits many different data formats whereas SOAP only permits XML.
REST allows better support for browser clients due to its support for JSON.
REST has better performance and scalability. REST reads can be cached, SOAP based reads cannot be cached.
If security is not a major concern and we have limited resources. Or we want to create an API that will be easily used by other developers publicly then 
we should go with REST.
If we need Stateless CRUD operations then go with REST.
REST is commonly used in social media, web chat, mobile services and Public APIs like Google Maps.
RESTful service returns various MediaTypes for the same resource, depending on the request header parameter "Accept" as application/xml or application/json 
for POST and /user/1234.json or GET /user/1234.xml for GET.
REST services are meant to be called by the client-side application and not the end user directly.
ST in REST comes from State Transfer. You transfer the state around instead of having the server store it, this makes REST services scalable.

18. What are the factors that help to decide which style of Web services - SOAP or REST - to use?
Generally, REST is preferred due to its simplicity, performance, scalability, and support for multiple data formats.
However, SOAP is favorable to use where service requires an advanced level of security and transactional reliability.
But you can read the following facts before opting for any of the styles.

Does the service expose data or business logic? REST is commonly used for exposing data while SOAP for logic.
Requirement from clients or providers for a formal contract. SOAP can provide contract via WSDL.
Support multiple data formats.
Support for AJAX calls. REST can apply the XMLHttpRequest.
Synchronous and asynchronous calls. SOAP enables both synchronous/ asynchronous operations whereas REST has built-in support for synchronous.
Stateless or Stateful calls. REST is suited for stateless operations.
Security. SOAP provides a high level of security.
Transaction support. SOAP is good at transaction management.
Limited bandwidth. SOAP has a lot of overhead when sending/receiving packets since it's XML based, requires a SOAP header. However, REST requires less bandwidth 
to send requests to the server. Its messages are mostly built using JSON.
Ease of use. REST based application is easy to implement, test, and maintain.


Ready to succeed

Though SOAP API questions may vary widely depending on the positions you apply, we hope our list would benefit you all by giving you general understandings
 of SOAP API testing, and helping you to plan ahead for the technical interviews or get ready for your upcoming role or projects related to SOAP testing.


Wish you all luck and confidence in your testing career! Any suggestions would be more than welcomed to make our list better and more adequate to all testers.

1) Explain what is JMeter?

JMeter is a Java tool, which is used for performance Load Testing.

2) Explain how JMeter works?

JMeter acts like a group of users sending requests to a target server. It collects response from the target server and other statistics which show the 
performance of the application or server via graphs or tables.

3) Explain where you can use functions and variables?

Variables and functions can be written into any field of any test component

4) Mention what are regular expressions in JMeter?

Based on the pattern, a regular expression is used to search and manipulate text. JMeter is useful in interpreting forms of regular expression or patterns 
being used throughout a JMeter test plan.

5) Explain what is Samplers and Thread groups?

Thread group: For any test plan, JMeter is the beginning part of thread group elements. It is an important element of JMeter, where you can set a number 
of users and time to load all the users given in the thread group
Samplers: Sampler generates one or more sample results; these sample results have many attributes like elapsed time, data size, etc. Samplers allow 
JMeter to send specific types of requests to the server, through samplers, thread group decides which type of request it needs to make. Some of the 
useful samplers are HTTP request, FTP request, JDBC request and so on.
6) Whether the test plans built using JMeter are OS dependent?

Usually, Test Plan are saved in their XML format, so there is nothing to do with any particular O.S. It can be run on any OS where JMeter can run.

7) Mention what are the types of a processor in JMeter?

The types of a processor in JMeter are

Pre-processor
Post processor
8) Explain what are Pre-processor Elements? List some of the pre-processor elements?

A pre-processor is something that will happen before the sampler executes. To configure the sample request prior to its execution or to update variables
 that are not extracted from response text pre-processor elements are used.

Some of the pre-processor elements are

HTTP URL re-writing modifier
HTTP user parameter modifier
HTML link parser
BeanShell PreProcessor
9) Mention the execution order of Test Elements?

The test plans elements execution order is

Configuration elements
Pre-processors
Timers
Samplers
Post-processors
Assertions
Listeners
10) What does "contain" and "matches" indicates in the regular expression?

In the regular expression, contains indicates that the regular expression matched at least some part of the target. While matches mean the regular 
expression matched the whole target. So, 'alphabet' is "matched" by 'al.*t.'

11) Explain what is the configuration elements?

A configuration element works parallel with a Sampler. To set up defaults and variables for later use by samplers configuration elements can be 
used. At the start of the scope, these elements are processed before any samplers in the same scope.

12) Explain what is a timer in JMeter and what are the types of it?

A JMeter thread by default will send requests continuously without any pause. To get a pause between the request, Timers are used. Some of the 
Timers used are Constant Timer, Gaussian Random Timer, Synchronizing Timer, Uniform Random Timer and so on.

13) Explain what is Test Fragment?

Test fragment is also a type of element like Thread Group element. The only difference is test fragment is not implemented unless it is 
referenced by either a Module controller or an Include controller.

14) Explain what is Assertion in JMeter? What are the types of assertion?

Assertion helps to verify that your server under test returns the expected results

Some commonly used Assertion in JMeter are

Response Assertion
Duration Assertion
Size Assertion
XML Assertion
HTML Assertion
15) Explain how you can reduce the resource requirement in JMeter?

To reduce the resource requirements in JMeter

Use non-GUI mode: jmeter -n -t test.jmx -l test.jtl
During the load, a test doesn't use "view results tree" or "view results in table" listeners, use them only during the scripting phase
Don't use functional mode
Instead of using lots of similar samplers, use the same sampler in a loop and use the variable to vary the sample
16) Explain how you can perform spike testing in JMeter?

By synchronizing, timer JMeter spike Testing can be achieved. Synchronizing timer blocks thread until a specific amount of threads has 
been blocked and then release them all together thus creating large instantaneous load.

17) Explain how you can capture the script of the authentication window in JMeter?

Normally, you can capture script by recording.

First, you have to Threadgroup in Testplan and then make HTTPProxyServer in Workbench
After that, set port number in the Global Setting box (e.g., 8911) and modify your connection setting in IE as localhost in address 
8911 as in port Then you can start http proxy server in JMeter and run your application for login
18) List out few JMeter Listeners?

Some of the JMeter Listeners are

Spline Visualizer
Aggregate Report
View Result Tree
View Result in Table
Monitor Results
Distribution Graph
BeanShell Listener
Summary Report and so on
19) What is distributed load testing? How can it be achieved?

Distributed load testing is the process through which numerous systems can be used for simulating a load of a large number of users. 
By using the master-slave configuration, JMeter can do distribute load testing.

20) In JMeter is it necessary to call embedded resources explicitly?

You can eliminate all embedded resources from being explicitly called. Requests have a checkbox at the bottom that says "retrieve 
embedded resources." It would grab all CSS, JPG, etc. It is a brilliant way to find resources and broken link in a web App.

21) Explain what is the role of Timer in JMeter?

With the help of a timer, JMeter can delay the time between each request, which a thread makes. It can solve the overload problem 
of the server.

22) Explain what is Post-processor?

To perform any action after making a request, Post-processor is used. For example, if JMeter sends an HTTP request to the web server,and
if you want JMeter to stop sending the request if the web server shows an error, then you will use post-processor to perform this action.


23) What are the benefits that JMeter offers for performance testing?

JMeter offers benefits on Performance Testing like

It can be used to test performance for both, static resources as well as dynamic resources
It can handle a maximum number of concurrent users then your website can handle
It provides the graphical analyses of performance reports


<b id="GN__LoadRunner_interview_questions:">GN__LoadRunner_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

1) Which protocols are supported by LoadRunner?

As of LoadRunner 9.5 following protocols are supported. This will increase with future releases. The interviewer is not looking for 
you to name all but a few (say 5-7 protocols).

Application Deployment Solution: For the Citrix protocol.
Client/Server: For DB2 CLI, DNS, MS SQL, ODBC, Oracle (2-tier), Sybase
Ctlib, Sybase Dblib, and Windows Sockets protocols.
Custom: For C templates, Visual Basic templates, Java templates,
Javascript and VBScript type scripts.
Distributed Components: For COM/DCOM, Corba-Java, and Rmi -Java protocols.
E-business: For FTP, LDAP, Palm, Web (HTTP/HTML), Web Services, and the dual Web/Winsocket protocols.
Enterprise Java Beans: For EJB Testing and Rmi-Java protocols.
ERP/CRM: For Baan, Oracle NCA, Peoplesoft-Tuxedo, Peoplesoft 8,
SAPGUI, SAP-Web, and Siebel (Siebel-DB2CLI, Siebel-MSSQL, Siebel-Web, and Siebel-Oracle) protocols.
Legacy: For Terminal Emulation (RTE).
Mailing Services: Internet Messaging (IMAP), MS Exchange (MAPI), POP3, and SMTP.
Middleware: Jacada and Tuxedo (6, 7) protocols.
Streaming: For MediaPlayer and RealPlayer protocols.

2) Which components have you used in LoadRunner?

Vuser generator - For generating Scripts

Controller - For creating and executing scenarios

Analyzer - To analyze results.

Learn more about LoadRunner and its architecture in this video lesson.

3) What is load runner Agent?

The Agent is interface between host machine and controller.

4) What is the process for developing a Vuser Script?

There are four steps for developing a vuser script.
1-Record the Vuser Script.
2-Playback / Enhance the recorded vuser script.
3- Define the various run-time settings & check

4- Incorporate the script in a LoadRunner scenario

Learn more about Vuser Script development in the Video tutorial here.

5) How many VUsers are required for load testing?

This is essentially a trick question.

The number of VUsers required depends on your system under test, network configurations, hardware settings, memory, operating 
system, software applications objective of a performance test. There can not be any generic value for Vuser.

6) What is the difference in running the Vuser as a process and as a thread? Which is more advantageous way of running Vuser?

When Vuser is run as a process, the same driver program is loaded into memory for each Vuser. This will take a large amount of 
memory and will limit the number of Vusers you can run on a single generator.

When Vuser is run as a thread, only one instance of driver program is shared by given number of Vusers. You can run a number of 
Vusers on a single generator using the multi-threading mode.

7) What is the significance of "Vuser-init "?

Vuser-init records the pre-operations also called the initialization operations before the actual application is run.

8) What is extended log?

An extended log will store information such as data returned by an advanced trace, parameter substitution and much other 
information depending on the options you select in run-time settings.

9) Why do you create parameter?

To create a parameter you will replace the hard-coded value within the script and replace it with a parameter. This allows a 
single Vuser to be run many times, and to use different data on each run. It helps in stimulating more real-life server 
demand as it prevents a server from caching results.

Learn more about parameterization in this Video Tutorial

10) How will you divide your script into multiple Actions? Why?

I will divide the script into Actions based on the functionality. For example, Once Action for Logining into Application, 
another Action for booking and so on.

Actions increase code reusability, reduce maintenance time and hence, decrease costs.

11) How can you set the number of Vusers in LoadRunner?

You can set the number of Vusers in the controller section while creating your scenarios. Many other advanced options like 
ramp-up, ramp-down of Vusers are also available in the Controller section.

Learn more about Controller & Scenario creation

12) What are monitors?

Monitors are used to "monitor" performance bottlenecks. They are used in Controller section of Load Runner

13) What are the types of checkpoints is available in LoadRunner?

LoadRunner provides two types of checkpoints

a) Image Checkpoints: This checkpoint will verify the presence of an image on a page during run-time

b) Text Checkpoint: This checkpoint will verify the presence of a text-string on a page during run-time


Both of the above checkpoints can be added in Vugen.

Learn more about Checkpoints

14) What kind of problem can we face regarding hardware, software, network and memory bottleneck during the performance test?

The possible issues amongst others could be -

1. Lack of Hardware

2. Memory Leakage

3. Network related issues.

4. Application/Software error

15) What would be your recommendation to improve performance measure?

Fine Tuning of network, database, and app and the web server is recommended.

At the network, level tryes to optimize the latency and bandwidth.

At the database level, verify all indexes and sequences by running profilers. You may also optimize your database queries.

At the App server level, run profilers for finding the memory leaks in the application

At the web server level, you can use monitors and optimize the throughput and other related metrics of the server.

16) What is Rendezvous point?

The Rendezvous point is Synchronization/Wait point. Rendezvous points instruct Vusers to wait during test execution for 
multiple Vusers to arrive at a certain point, in order that they may simultaneously perform a task.

The significance of this is to emulate some heavy load only to the particular portion of the scenario and test the behavior of 
the application.

17) What is Correlation?

Correlation is used to obtain data which is unique for each run of your test script (ex: session ids). While recording, 
these dynamic values are hard-coded in your script causing the script to fail during playback. Correlation is a technique 
where dynamic values are not hard-coded in your script but are extracted at run-time to avoid failure.


18) What is Manual Correlation?

It's correlation technique which uses function Web_reg_save_param() to identify dynamic values in your script. It is important 
that your playback your script to verify that correlation is done successfully.

Learn Manual Correlation.

19) How do you identify the performance bottlenecks? -

The Performance Bottlenecks can be detected by using monitors.

These monitors might be application server monitors, web server monitors, database server monitors and network monitors.

They help in finding out the troubled area in our scenario which causes increased response time.

The measurements made are usually a performance response time, throughput, hits/sec, network delay graphs, etc

20) Which function is used to end a nested transaction?

The function is - lr_end_sub_transaction

Learn More about Transactions in this video.

21) What is the difference between transaction and transaction instance in LoadRunner?

A transaction is used to measure the time between executions of certain statements

A transaction instance is used for performance analysis

22) While the script is running we find some values that may need to be correlated? Is it possible to do manual correlation for 
those values?

NO. It's not possible to do correlation when a script is running but you can make changes once a script has stopped.

23) What is Elapsed Time in Load Runner?

Elapsed time designates how much time has passed since the launch of the current event and is measured differently for different 
screens as given below -

In Scenario Status Window - Elapsed time is measured from the moment you hit "Start Scenario" or " Initialize/Run Vuser?" button.

In "Vuser" window elapsed time is measured from the moment Vuser enters "running" state.

24) Does caching have a negative effect on your load testing results?

Yes. Caching has a negative effect. Cache is a temporary memory which stores your browsing history. When you visit a page for the 
SECOND time, the time required to load the page will be less than that required to load the page for your first visit since much 
of the information required to load the page is grabbed from the cache instead of the server. This will effect the response times 
in your test. Hence, it is recommended to turn-off caching.

25) What is the difference between Overlay graph and Correlate graph?

Overlay Graph: It will overlay the content of two graphs that share a common x-axis

Correlate Graph: It will Plot the Y-axis of two graphs against each other.

Learn more about Analyzer

26) What is the difference between lr_error_message and lr_debug _message?

lr_error_message - Sends an error message to the LoadRunner Controller's Output window

lr_debug _message - Sends a debug message to the LoadRunner Controller's Output window

27) What is the difference between load, performance testing?

The objective of the performance testing is to check whether an application loads/updates within stipulated time limit (say 2 seconds). 
It uses metrics like response time, Requests per second. It is carried out under production - like load conditions.

The objective of load testing is to check scalability of the system. For example, finding out the maximum number of users supported 
by the system within certain specifications.

28) You have created several Auto-Correlation rules. A new tester on your team is preparing to record a group of scripts on the same 
application on his workstation. What can you do to provide the tester with the correlation rules?

I would export the Auto-Correlation rules to a .cor file, and then have the new team member import the .cor file into his Auto 
Correlation rules

29) You want to emulate a call center for an airline. All representatives login in the morning, perform their business processes 
and log out at night. In one day, a representative will Create 40 flight reservations, Modify 10 flight reservations, and Search 
for 20 flight reservations. A representative cannot perform a Modify without performing a Search first. How would you design the run logic?

Create - 67% Search - 16% Block0 - 17% Search Modify

30) Where should you add a web_reg_save_param function to a script?

Before the step that retrieves the dynamic value

31) You want to have each step in your script measured as a transaction in the Controller and not shown in the Replay Log in 
VuGen. How can you accomplish this?

This can be done by enabling the automatic transaction in the Run-time settings.

32) Which web protocol recording level generates the web_submit_form function?

The HTML based recording generates this function.

33) What is load testing?

Load testing is to test that if the application works well with the loads from large number of simultaneous users and transactions. 
It also used to determine whether it can handle peak usage periods.

34) What is load runner?

Load Runner is a performance testing tool from HP. This tool supports all aspects such as Load, Stress, Endurance, data volume 
and spike Testing.

35) What are all the components of LoadRunner?

Following are the components of LoadRunner

The Virtual User Generator
Controller, and the Agent process
LoadRunner Analysis and Monitoring
LoadRunner Books Online
36) What Component of LoadRunner is used to record a script?

The Virtual User Generator (VuGen) component is used to record a script, and it enables you to develop Vuser scripts for a variety 
of application types and communication protocols.

37) What is a rendezvous point?

Rendezvous points are introduced into Vuser scripts to simulate more users on the server. Rendezvous points instruct Vusers to wait 
during test execution in order to perform the tasks simultaneously.

For example, in a banking application, Rendezvous points are inserted for 100+ multiple users to deposit money simultaneously.

38) What is a scenario?

A scenario is nothing but an event that occurs for each testing session.

For example, a scenario defines

Number of users
Action to be performed
Virtual machines system
39) How can we debug a LoadRunner script?

VuGen contains two options to debug Vuser scripts.

Run Step by Step command and
Breakpoints.
We can also manually set the message class within your script using the lr_set_debug_message function.

40) How can we perform functional testing under load?

Functionality under load can be tested by running several Vusers concurrently. By increasing the Vusers, it is necessary to determine
 how much load the server can sustain.

41) What is the relationship between Response Time and Throughput?

The Throughput shows the amount of data in bytes that the Vusers received from the server in a second. When It is compared with 
transaction response time, throughput and response time get decreased.

The peak throughput and highest response time would occur approximately at the same time.

42) What do vuser_init and vuser_end action contain?

Vuser_init action contains procedures to log in to a server and Vuser_end section contains logoff procedures.

43) What is the difference between standard log and extended log?

The standard log sends a subset of functions and messages to the output log and subset of functions depends on the Vuser type.

Extended log sends a detailed script execution messages to the output log. It is mainly used during debugging when a user needs 
information about Parameter substitution.

44) What are all the types of Goals in Goal-Oriented Scenario of Load Runner?

Load Runner provides you with five different types of goals:

Number of concurrent Vusers
Number of hits per second
Number of transactions per second
Number of pages per minute
Transaction response time
45) What is a function to capture dynamic values in the web vuser script?

Web_reg_save_param is the function that saves dynamic data information to a parameter.

46) What is the Load Runner testing process?

Following are the testing process in LoadRunner:

Plan load test
Create Vuser Scripts
Define Scenario
Run Scenario
Analyze results
47) What is remote command launcher?

The remote command launcher enables the controller to start applications in the host machine.

48) How can we develop the database vuser script?

Vuser scripts can be developed either by recording with the load vuser script generator or by using the Load runner vuser script 
template.

49) How do you load a load runner Agent?

While running the scenario, LoadRunner controller instructs the remote agent dispatcher to launch LoadRunner agent. The controller 
instructs the LoadRunner agent to initialize, run, pause and stop the vusers.

50) What is the difference between hits/second and requests/second?

Hits per second mean the number of hits the server receives in one second from the vuser.

Request per second is the number of request the vuser will request from the server.

51) What are the advantages of load runner?

Following are the advantages of Load Runner:

Reduces human intervention
Reduces the requirement of the systems
Helps in the better use of time and money
Effective utilization of automation
Single point execution
52) What is the vuser in the scenario?

The vuser is the virtual users who can simulate the real users. The virtual users who take the place of real users's operating client 
software, such as IE sending requests using the HTTP protocol to IIS or Apache web servers.

53) How do we write a user-defined function in LoadRunner?

Use should create the external library that contains the function. This library must then be added to the bin directory of VuGen. 
And then, the user-defined function can be assigned as a parameter.

54) What are the changes that can be made to run-time settings?

There are four run-time settings that can be made:

Pacing: This contains iteration count.
Log: Logging can be set to standard or disabled.
Think Time:  Capable of setting think time to be ignored or replaced.
General:  Allows the setting of Vusers for processes or multi-threading.
55) How can we find database related issues?

Monitors and the Data Resource Graph can be used to find database related issues. LoadRunner allow the tester to specify the 
resource that needs to be measured before the controller is run.

56) How many types of graphs are available in LoadRunner?

There are five types of graphs:

Network delay time graph - displays the time that elapses between request and response
Two transaction response time graphs - one translation response time graph for load and another one for percentile
Hits/second graph - Shows application traffic volume
Pages download/second graph - shows the rate at which pages are downloaded per second
57) How can performance bottlenecks be identified?

Monitors can be used to detect a performance bottlenecks. These include network, web server, application server, and database 
server monitors.

These monitors can be used to locate trouble spots in scenarios that cause an increase in response time and throughput, network 
delays, performance response time, hits/second, etc.

58) What is a ramp up and how it can be set?

Ramp up is gradually increasing the load on a server and can be simulated by gradually increasing the number of Vusers.  This 
feature can be found in the Scenario Scheduling Options.

59) How can correlation be performed?

Correlation can be performed in two ways:

Use the scan function to search for correlations and select a value from the result.
Record a pair of scripts and then compare them to each other.
60) Where are automatic correlation options set?

The automatic correlation is set in recording options area on the correlation tab. Correlation can be enabled for the full 
script and rules for correlation can be defined.

Automatic correlation can be performed on a database by viewing the output window, scanning for correlation, and selecting 
the value that will be used.

61) What is the benefit of running a Vuser script as a thread?

The advantage of running a Vuser script as a thread which allows more Vusers to be used for one load generator. Running Vuser 
scripts as processes utilizes a lot of memory because all of the loaded scripts use the same driver.

This limits the number of Vuser scripts that can be run on one generator.

62) What is the difference between Overlay graph and Correlate graph?

Overlay Graph:

Overlay graph has one X-axis and 2 Y-axis. Left Y-axis on the merged graph shows the current graph's value & Right Y-axis 
show the value of Y-axis of the graph that was merged.

Correlate Graph:

There are two graphs, and the active graph's Y-axis becomes X-axis of merged graph. Y-axis of the graph that was merged 
becomes merged graph's Y-axis.

63) What are the three sections of a Vuser script and what is the purpose of each one?

Following are the three sections of Vuser script, and they are as follows:

Vuser_init - Used for recording the logon.

<table class="table table-striped"> <tbody> <tr> <td><p><b></b></p><center><b>Manual Scenario</b></center> </td> <td><p><b></b></p><center><b>Goal Scenario</b></center> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Main purpose is to learn how many Vusers can run concurrently</td> <td>Goal may be throughput, response time, or number of concurrent Vusers</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gives you manual control over how many Vusers run and at what time</td> <td>Load Runner manages Vusers automatically</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>

68) What are all the reasons to use the Server Resources Monitor?

Server resources monitor is used to find how much data is coming from Cache and helps to find out what are all the parts 
of the system have bottlenecks.

69) What is the purpose of selecting 'Show browser' during replay in the General Options settings?

'Show Browser' setting is used to see the pages that appear during playback. This is useful for debugging Vuser during 
the initial stages of Web Vuser creation.

70) For what purpose, User will be using 'continue on' error?

Continue on should be set only when making Execution Logs more descriptive or adding logic to the Vuser.

71) What is the purpose of a LoadRunner transaction?

The purpose of a Load Runner transaction is to measure one or more steps/user actions of a business process.

72) Why do you create parameters?

Parameters are like script variables, and they are used to vary input to the server to emulate real users.

Different sets of data are sent to the server whenever the script is run.
Better simulate the usage model for more accurate testing from the Controller, and one script can emulate many 
different users on the system.
73) What is lr_output_message?

The lr_output_message is a function that sends notifications to the Controller Output window and to the Vuser log file.

74) In a Web server, Database and Network are all working fine and now, Where could be the problem?

The problem could be in the system itself or in the application server or in the code written for the application.

75) What is VuGen Recording and Scripting? 

LoadRunner script code is obtained by recording in the ANSI C language syntax and it can be viewed in the script view.

76) What is Performance testing in LoadRunner? 

Performance testing can be done by calculating the timing for both read and update transactions and check whether system 
functions are being performed in an acceptable time frame. In a multi-user environment, it is necessary to determine the 
effect of multiple transactions on the timing of a single transaction.

77) What is the Configuration of systems when using Load Runner? 

The configuration of systems refers to that of the client machines in which we will run Vusers. The configuration of client 
machine includes its hardware settings, memory, operating system, software applications, development tools, etc.

This system component configuration should match with the overall system configuration so as to achieve the load testing 
objectives.

78) What is the use lr_abort function?

The lr_abort function is used to abort the execution of a Vuser script. It instructs the Vuser to stop executing the Actions 
section, execute the vuser_end section and end the execution.

79) What is think time?

Think time is the time where a real user waits between actions.

When a user receives data from a server or other applications, the user may wait several seconds to review the data before 
responding. This time delay is called as think time.

18) What is white box testing and black box testing?

Black box testing means testing the software for the outputs on giving particular inputs. This testing is usually performed 
to see if the software meets the user's requirements. There is no specific functional output expected for running this test.

The white box testing is done to check the accuracy of code and logic of the program. This testing is done by the programmer 
who knows the logical flow of the system.

19) How does QTP evaluate test results?

Once the testing is done, QTP will generate a report. This report will show the checkpoints, system message and error that 
were detected while testing. The test results window will show any mismatches encountered at the checkpoints.

20) Explain the QTP testing process?

QTP testing process is based on following steps:
Creating GUI (Graphical User Interface) Map files : Identifies the GUI object which has to be tested
Creating test scripts: Test scripts are recorded

Run tests: Testcases should be run.
View results: The results reflects the success or failure of the tests
Report detects: If the test is failed, the reasons will be recorded in the report detect file
21) What is load testing and give some examples of it?

To measure the system response, load testing is done. If the load exceeds the users pattern it is known as stress testing. 
Examples of load testing are downloading the set of large files, executing multiple applications on a single computer, 
subjecting a server to large number of e-mails and allotting many tasks to a printer one after another.

22) How to test database manually?

24) Give some useful tips on JIRA Workflow

As such Statuses are global objects in JIRA. Changing the name of the status on one workflow will change the status on all workflows that use that status
Hover over status or transition to see the relevant transition labels
One cannot clone transitions in the workflow designer
In the workflow designer, one cannot create annotations
Directly you cannot set the issue editable property.
25) What are the limitations when editing an active workflow?

If a workflow is active, you cannot edit the workflow name (only the description)
You cannot delete the workflow steps
A step associated status cannot be edited
You cannot add any new outgoing transition if a step has no outgoing transitions (Global transitions are not considered).
A step's Step ID cannot be changed.
26) In JIRA workflow, is it possible to transition an issue back to its previous status?

Practically, it is not possible to transition an issue back to its previous status.  However, you can use the "on hold" feature to transition an 
issue back to its prior status. Here are the steps,

In a workflow, Create a global transition to the 'On Hold' state.
Now from 'On Hold' status create another transition to every other status you want to come back to
Since the transition names cannot be the same, add a blank space at the end of it.
Now you don't want the status transition from the 'On Hold' and 'Done' to 'On Hold' So you will hide the other status "On Hold" by adding the 
value field condition on the global transition.
27) What is the role of Validators in JIRA?

The Validators in JIRA checks that any input made to the transition is valid before the transition is performed.  If a validator fails, the 
issue will not progress to the destination status of the transition.

28) What types of Post functions are carried out after the transition is executed?

Types of Post functions carried out after transition is executed includes

Adding a comment to an issue
Generating change history for an issue
Updating an issue's fields
Generating an event to trigger email notifications
29) What is an event in JIRA?

The events are classified in two a System event (JIRA defined events) and Custom event (User-defined events). An event describes the status, 
the default template and the notification scheme and workflow transition post function associations for the event.

30) What is the Audit Log?

Under Audit Log, you can see all the details about the issue created, and the changes made in the issues.

31) For an Agile project, how user stories in JIRA are created?

For an Agile project to create user stories in JIRA, follow below steps.

Issue type -Epic and Issue type - Story linked to it. In order to do so, in the 'Create Issue' page, go to "Configure Fields" and select 
"Epic link" field to be included in the issue creation screen.
Or you can have a product backlog by creating a main User story and having various sub-tasks under it.
32) What is an "issue collector"?

An "issue collector" enables you to easily embed a JIRA feedback form into your own web site. This helps website visitors to log issues into 
JIRA through our website.  To use JIRA feedback form, visitors to our website do not need a user account in JIRA.

33)  State the difference between Bugzilla and JIRA?

<table class="table table-striped" width="50%"> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Bugzilla</strong></td> <td><strong>JIRA</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><ul> <li>It is an Open Source</li> </ul> </td> <td><ul> <li>It is a commercial tool</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><ul> <li>Using Bugzilla might be little complicated for few due to grouping users and granting permissions</li> </ul> </td> <td><ul> <li>For some using JIRA would be more convenient than Bugzilla</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><ul> <li>Bugzilla allows you to show/hide the whole custom field or specific values based on the value of some other field</li> </ul> </td> <td><ul> <li>JIRA enables conditional configuration based only on Type fields and Project.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><ul> <li>Bugzilla's has a powerful advanced search option</li> </ul> </td> <td><ul> <li>JIRA lacks advance-level search options. JIRA has a flexible JQL language (JIRA Query Language). It enables you to build arbitrary boolean expressions.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><ul> <li>Unlike JIRA, Bugzilla allows users to select the initial status of a new issue.</li> </ul> </td> <td><ul> <li>Unlike Bugzilla, JIRA enables you to define multiple workflows which are applied based on the issue's Project and Type.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><ul> <li>Bugzilla has only one link type: Blocks/depends and a Bug ID custom field</li> </ul> </td> <td><ul> <li>JIRA has configurable link types with user-defined semantics. JIRA enables to link an issue to any other entity outside JIRA.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>

<b id="GN__SOAPUI_interview_questions:">GN__SOAPUI_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

1) Explain what is SOAP UI?

SOAP UI is a free, open source cross-platform functional Testing solution.  It enables you to rapidly and easily create 
and execute automated regression, compliance, functional and load tests. Its used for Web Services Testing

2) Explain what is the role of XML, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI in web services?

Web services are a medium through which web based application can be integrated or communicated over an internet protocol backbone. 
Web based application can be integrated using XML, SOAP, UDDI and WSDL. SOAP is used for transmitting the data; WSDL is used for 
describing or relating the services, UDDI is used for listing what services are accessible, XML is used to tag the data.

3) Mention what SoapUI can do?

SoapUI can-

It can do automated testing like load tests, scenario-based tests and data driven tests
It has got built-in reporting abilities
It has got unique ability to impersonate Web services and run functional and load test against them even before they are executed
4) Mention how SoapUI is used to structure functional tests?

SOAP UI uses three levels to structure functional tests

TestSuite: It is a pool of test cases used for combining functional tests into logical units
TestCase: It is a group of test steps that are bring together to test some specific aspect of your services. You can augment any 
number of testcases to test suites
TestSteps: They are "building blocks" of functional tests in SOAPUI. They together makes TestCase and determines the flow of execution 
of the service to be tested
5) Mention what is the difference between REST and SOAP?

SOAP: Soap stands for Simple Object Access Protocol and it is a protocol used for receiving and sending data over HTTP as XML
REST: It is a way of designing a web services.
6) Explain what is the properties in SoapUI?

Properties in SOAPUI is used to retrieve and store data.  The data is stored as key, value or format.

7) Explain where you use properties in SoapUI?

We can read the property values into test step endpoint, username, header values, password, domain, POST, PUT, GET and DELETE method properties.

8) Mention what languages does SoapUI use?

SOAP UI supports two language, Groovy, and JavaScript.

9) Mention what are the default properties in SOAPUI?

By default, SOAPUI has properties at three levels

Project level default or custom properties: User can append any number of properties at project level and it can be opened from 
any test steps from any test cases under any test suites
Test suite level default or custom properties: User can append any number properties at test suite level and it can be used from 
any test steps from any test cases under this test suite
Test case level default or custom properties: At Test Case level users can add any number properties at test case level and it 
can be used from any test steps from this test case
10) Explain how you can parameterize the endpoints in SOAP UI?

To parameterize the endpoints in SOAP UI is most important as it is the first step in Automation Testing.  It is more time consuming 
for changing endpoints manually.  In order to do that

Define a project property holding the endpoint
Change the endpoint to use this property via property expansion
Ensure that your requests are availing the configured endpoint
When a request is run, the property will inevitably be with its current value. To use a different value just configure the endpoint 
in the UI, you can use the P option from the command line
11) Mention what is the general format for reading the custom or default property value?

The general format for reading the custom or default property value is ${#levelname#key}

12) Inside the SOAPUI where groovy script can be used?

Inside the SOAPUI groovy script can be used in two places

Groovy script test step
Script Assertion- within test step
13) Mention some important functionalities of SOAP UI?

Some important functionalities of SOAP UI are:

It creates a new project using only the web service WSDL link; it will get the information of all methods and import them automatically
It creates test cases directly from the web method request
It tests web methods in combination or separately. It has a very useful capability which allows datas and parameters to be passed from 
one method to another.  It enables you to save data in variables so other methods can access it
It enables creating validations on the web method results through assertions; the assertion can be created either in X-path or X-query
It helps in creating other types of validations like schema compliance, soap fault, response time etc.
It enables organizing the test cases in test suites
It enables running all test cases from a test suite and getting fail/pass results for each test case
It enables parameterization of the test cases request fields so that a test case can avail different values from a table or database
Using groovy it enables creating complex validation scripts
It has some support for web service Load Testing
It has some support for testing coverage and requirements management
14) Explain what assertion is in Soap UI is and give some example of assertion possible in SOAPUI?

In SOAP UI assertion functionality is used to validate the response of request received by the Test Steps at the time of execution.  
It is used to compare a part of message to some expected value.

Assertion types in SOAPUI includes

Simple contains
Schema compliance
Simple not contains
Soap Faults
Response SLA
XPath Match
XQuery Match
WS security status
Script Assertion
WS- Addressing Request or Response Assertion

ANDROID SDK
JDK
TestNG
Eclipse
Selenium Server JAR
Webdriver Language Binding Library
APPIUM for Windows
APK App Info On Google Play
js
4) List out the limitations of using Appium?

Appium does not support testing of Android Version lower than 4.2
Limited support for hybrid app testing. E.g., not possible to test the switching action of application from the web app to 
native and vice-versa
No support to run Appium Inspector on Microsoft Windows
5) Explain how to find DOM element or xPath in a mobile application?

To find the DOM element use "UIAutomateviewer" to find DOM element for Android application.

6) Explain the design concept of Appium?

Appium is an "HTTP Server" written using Node.js platform and drives iOS and Android session using Webdriver JSON wire protocol. 
Hence, before initializing the Appium Server, Node.js must be pre-installed on the system
When Appium is downloaded and installed, then a server is setup on our machine that exposes a REST API
It receives connection and command request from the client and execute that command on mobile devices (Android / iOS)
It responds back with HTTP responses. Again, to execute this request, it uses the mobile test automation frameworks to drive 
the user interface of the apps. Framework like
Apple Instruments for iOS (Instruments are available only in Xcode 3.0 or later with OS X v10.5 and later)
Google UIAutomator for Android API level 16 or higher
Selendroid for Android API level 15 or less
7) What language does Appium support?

Appium support any language that support HTTP request like Java, JavaScript with Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, etc.

It opens the door to cross-platform mobile testing which means the same test would work on multiple platforms
Appium does not require extra components in your App to make it automation friendly
It can automate Hybrid, Web and Native mobile applications
Cons:

Running scripts on multiple iOS simulators at the same time is possible with Appium
It uses UIAutomator for Android Automation which supports only Android SDK platform, API 16 or higher and to support the older API's 
they have used another open source library called Selendroid
9) Explain what is APPIUM INSPECTOR?

Similar to Selenium IDE record and Playback tool, Appium has an "Inspector" to record and playback. It records and plays native 
application behavior by inspecting DOM and generates the test scripts in any desired language. However, Appium Inspector does not 
support Windows and use UIAutomator viewer in its option.

10) Mention what are the basic requirement for writing Appium tests?

For writing Appium tests you require,

Driver Client: Appium drives mobile applications as though it were a user. Using a client library you write your Appium tests which 
wrap your test steps and sends to the Appium server over HTTP.
Appium Session: You have to first initialize a session, as such Appium test takes place in the session. Once the Automation is done 
for one session, it can be ended and wait for another session
Desired Capabilities: To initialize an Appium session you need to define certain parameters known as "desired capabilities" like 
PlatformName, PlatformVersion, Device Name and so on. It specifies the kind of automation one requires from the Appium server.
Driver Commands: You can write your test steps using a large and expressive vocabulary of commands.
11) Mention what are the possible errors one might encounter using Appium?

The possible errors one might face in Appium includes

Error 1: The following desired capabilities are needed but not provided: Device Name, platformName
Error 2: Could not find adb. Please set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable with the Android SDK root directory path
Error 3: openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: A new session could not be created
Error 4: How to find DOM element or XPath in a mobile application?
12) Do you need a server machine to run tests on Appium?

No, you don't need server machine to run tests on Appium. Appium facilitates a 2-tier architecture where a test machine connects to a 
test server running Appium and automating the whole thing. You can have Appium running on the same machine where your test runs.

13) Is it possible to interact with my apps using Javascript while I am testing with Appium?

Yes, it is possible to interact with App while using Javascript. When the commands run on Appium, the server will send the script to 
your app wrapped into an anonymous function to be executed.

14) Mention what are the most difficult scenarios to test with Appium?

The most difficult scenario to test with Appium is data exchange.

15) While using Appium can I run my tests in a multithreaded environment?

Yes, you can run the test in a multithreaded environment but you have to ensure that no more than one test runs at the same time 
against the same Appium server.

16) In Android, do you need an app's .apk to automate using Appium or you also need app in my workspace?

In Android, you only need .apk file to automate using Appium.

17) Explain what is Appium package master? How to create package?

Appium package master is a set of tools manage and create appium packages. For example to create package you can use the code

# using es7/babe1

Gulp create-package -n <package-name>

#regular es5

Gulp create-package ---nobabe1 -n <package-name>

The package will be generated in the out/<package-name>

18) Explain how test frameworks are supported by Appium?

<b id="GN__QTP/UFT_interview_questions:">GN__QTP/UFT_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

1) What are the types object Repositories in Micro Focus UFT.

QTP Supports 2 types of Object Repository

1) Shared Object Repository (also called Global)

2) Per-Action Object Repository, (also called Local)

Per-Action Object Repository is used by default. The extension for Per-Action repository is ".mtr" .

Shared Object Repository is preferable while dealing with dynamic objects which are called in multiple tests. The extension is ".tsr"

2) Which environments are supported by HP QTP?

QTP supports the following environments

Active X
Delphi
Java
.Net
Oracle
People Soft
Power Builder
SAP
Siebel
Stingray
Terminal Emulator
Visual Basic
Visual Age
Web
Web Services
To learn more about Add-ins and how to use them, watch this video tutorial.

3) Can we call QTP test from another test using scripting. Suppose there are 4 tests and I want to call these tests in a main script. 
Is this possible in QTP?

Yes.  You can call 4 or even more scripts in your tests.For this, first you will need to make the Actions in the corresponding scripts 
re-usable.Then from the destination script you can make calls to these re-usable actions.

4) What is action split and the purpose of using this in QTP?

Action split is to divide an existing action into two parts.The purpose is to divide actions based on their functionality to improve code 
re-use.

5) How will you handle Java tree in QTP?

Foremost you will select Java Add - In and launch QTP. Next step record operations on the Java Tree. If you face an issue while recording, 
you can select Tools > Object Identification > Java, tree object and make changes in mandatory and assistive properties to enable identification.

Tip: You can base you answer on similar lines for any other object of any environment. For example : If the question is how will check SAP 
checkbox , You say , first I will select SAP Add in ... and so on.

6) Explain how QTP identifies object?

QTP identifies any GUI Object based on its corresponding properties.  While recording, QTP will identify and store peculiar properties (as defined 
in the Object Identification settings) in the object repository of the GUI object . At run-time, QTP will compare the stored property values with 
the on-screen properties, to uniquely identify the GUI object.


7) How many types of recording modes in QTP? Which will be used when?

QTP supports 3 types of recording modes  

1. Normal mode also called Contextual

2. Low-level recording mode

3.Analog mode

Normal Mode: It is the default recording mode and takes full advantage of QTP's Test Object Model. It recognizes objects regardless of their 
position on -screen. This is the preferred mode of recoding and is used for most of the automation activities.

Low-level recording mode: This mode records the exact x,y co-ordinates of your mouse operations. It is helpful in testing hashmaps. It is 
useful for recording objects not identified by normal mode of QTP.

Analog mode: This mode records exact mouse and keyboard "movements" you perform in relation to the screen / application window. This mode 
is useful for the operation such as drawing a picture, recording signature., drag and drop operations.

Learn more about Recording Modes in QTP

8) How will you  call from one action to another action?

We can call an action in 2 ways

1) Call to copy of Action. - In this ,the Action Object Repository , Script and Datable will be copied to the destination Test Script.
2) Call to Existing Action. - In this,  Object Repository , Script and Datable  will NOT be copied but a call (reference) would be made to the 
Action in the source script.

9) What are Virtual Objects?

Your application may contain objects that behave like standard objects but are not recognized by QTP. You can define these objects as virtual 
objects and map them to standard classes, such as a button or a check box. QTP emulates the user's action on the virtual object during the run 
session. In the test results, the virtual object is displayed as though it is a standard class object.

For example, suppose you want to record a test on a Web page containing a bitmap that the user clicks. The bitmap contains several different 
hyperlink areas, and each area opens a different destination page. When you record a test, the Web site matches the coordinates of the click 
on the bitmap and opens the destination page.

To enable QTP to click at the required coordinates during a run session, you can define a virtual object for an area of the bitmap, which 
includes those coordinates, and map it to the button class. When you run a test, QTP clicks the bitmap in the area defined as a virtual 
object so that the Web site opens the correct destination page.

10) How to perform Cross platform testing and Cross browser testing using QTP? Can u explain giving some example?

You will need to create separate Actions which take care of different OS and Browsers

Cross Platform Testing:

Using the Built in Environment Variable you can dig up the OS information.

Eg. Platform = Environment("OS"). Then based on the Platform you need to call the actions which you recorded on that particular platform.

Cross Browser Testing:

Using this code  Eg. Browser("Core Values").GetROProperty("version") you can extract the Browser and its correspondin version. Ex: Internet 
Explorer 6 or Netscape 5. Based on this value you call the actions which are relevant to that browser.

11) What is logical name of the object?

Logical name is a name  given by  QTP while creating an object in the repository to uniquely identify it from other objects in the application. 
This name would be used by the QTP to map the object name in script with its corresponding description in the object repository. Ex: Browser
("Browser").Page("Guru99") Here Guru99 is the logical name of the object.

12) What is descriptive programming?

Typically ,an object and its properties must be recorded in the Object Repository to enable QTP to perform action s on it. 

Using descriptive programming , you do not store the object and its property values in the Object repository but mention the property value 
pair directly in the script.

The idea behind descriptive programming is not bypass the object repository but help recogonize dynamic objects.

Learn more about Descriptive Programming

13)What are the properties you would use for identifying a browser & page when using descriptive programming?

You can use the name property

ex: Browser("name:="xxx"").page("name:="xxxx"").....  

OR

We can also use the property "micClass".

ex: Browser("micClass:=browser").page("micClass:=page")....

14)Can we record an application running on a remote machine using QTP?

Yes .you can record remote application provided you are accessing application through the local browser not via remoter like citrix.


If you are still unable to record it is advisable install QTP and application, on the same machine

15) Explain the keyword CreateObject with an example.

Creates and returns a reference to an Automation object

SYNTAX: CreateObject(servername.typename [, location])

Arguments

servername: Required. The name of the application providing the object.

typename :  Required. The type or class of the object to create.

location :  Optional. The name of the network server where the object is to be created.

Example : Set IE = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application")

16) Can you switch between Per-Action and Shared Object Repository? If yes how?

Yes .We can switch. Go to Test--->Settings--->Resources. Here  you have an option to choose repositories.

17) What is Object Spy ? How to Use it?

Object Spy helps in determining the run & test time object properties & methods of the application under test.

You can access object spy directly from the toolbar or from the Object Repository Dialog Box.

It is very useful during Descriptive Programming

Learn more about Object Spy

18) When ordinal identifiers alone can make an object unique then why they are not given top priority? Why it is first mandatory and 
next assistive. Why we cannot go for ordinal identifiers directly?

Consider the following -

a) If two objects are overlapped on each other than location based object recognition will fail.

b) If only index based recognition is used your script will work but script execution time will increase.

Hence mandatory and assistive properties are used.

19) What is the file extension of the code file in QTP?

Code file extension is script.mts

20) Explain in brief about the QTP Automation Object Model.

QTP Automation Object model deals with Automation of QTP itself. Almost all configuration and functionality provided by QTP is represented 
by QTP's Automation Object Model . Almost all dialog boxes in QTP have a corresponding automation object which can set or retrieved using 
the corresponding properties or methods in the Automation Object Model.QTP Automation Objects can be used along with standard VB programming 
elements like iterative loops or conditional statements to help you design a script of choice.

21) What is the use of Text output value in QTP?

Text Output values enable you to capture text appearing on the application under test during run-time.

If parameterized, text output values will capture values appearing in each iteration which would be stored in the run-time data table for 
further analysis.

22) What is Step Generator?

Step Generator enables use to Add Test Steps in your script. Using step generator you can add steps to your script without actually recording it.

23) How to make QTP understand the difference amongst the  same type of objects .Suppose there are 5 check boxes in a page and I have to 
choose the 2nd one, how to do that through script?

You can use ordinal identifiers like index along with a little descriptive programming for object recognition.

Watch a video of this example.

24) What is Test Fusion Report?

3) User-defined External (Read/Write)

You Set the Environment Variable  using the following syntax 

Environment.Value( "name") = "Guru99"

You can Retrieve the Environment Variable using following syntax

Environment.Value("name") -- This will retrun name as Guru99

Environment.Value("OS")  -- This will return your system OS

27) What is the Difference between Bitmap Check point & Image Check point? Bitmap checkpoint does a pixel to pixel comparison of an image 
or part of an image.

30)  Explain QTP Testing process?

Quick Test testing process consists of 6 main phases:

1)  Create your test plan - This is preparatory phase where you identify the exact test steps, test data and expected results for you 
automated test. You also identify the environment and system configurations required to create and run your QTP Tests.

2) Recording a session on your application - During this phase , you will execute test steps one by one on your AUT ,and QTP will 
automatically record corresponding VB script statements for each step performed.

3) Enhancing your test - In this stage you will insert checkpoints , output values , parameterization , programming logic like if...else 
loops to enhance the logic of your test script.

4) Replay & Debug - After enhancements you will replay the script to check whether its working properly and debug if necessary.

5) Run your Tests - In this phase you will perform the actual execution of your Test Script.

6) Analyzing the test results - Once test run is complete, you will analyze the results in the Test Fusion report generated.

7) Reporting defects - Any incidents identified needs to be reported. If you are using Quality Center , defects can be automatically 
raised for failed tests in QTP.

in the Test Results Folder.  It can also be accessed in the Test Fusion Report.

34) What is the difference between check point and output value.

Check point is a verification point that compares a current value for a specified property with the expected value for that property. 
Based on this comparison, it will generate a PASS or FAIL status. 

An output value is a value captured during the test run and can be stored in a specified location like the  Datable or even a variable. 
Unlike Checkpoints, no PASS/FAIL status is generated.

 GetRoProperty is a standard method provided by QTP to fetch property values of a run -time object.

42) What is smart Identification?

Typically, if even one of the on-screen object property does not match the recorded object property. The test fails.

In smart identification, QTP does not give an error if the property values do not match, but uses Base filter and Optional Filter 
properties to uniquely identify an object. In Smart identification, if a property value does not match the script does not fail 
but it proceeds ahead to compare the next property. Smart identification can be enabled in Object Identification Dialog box.

Learn more about SMART Identification

43) How would you export a Script from one PC to another in QTP?

We can make use of the "Generate Script" function available in Object Identification, Test Settings and Tools/Options tab to create a 
zip of the script at the source computer. These zip files then can be imported into QTP at the destination computer.

44) Can launch two instances of QTP on the same machine?

No. You can work with only single instance of QTP on the same machine. But QTP itself can work on multiple instances of the Application 
Under Test (AUT). Ex:  QTP can handle multiple IE browser windows.

Either through object repository or description programming, UFT identifies objects.  Descriptive programming is used in following 
scenarios

a)      It is used to remove duplicate objects.  Same objects exists in different screens or windows of your application.  If you 
use OR in this case you have to store same object under different object hierarchy in OR.  To deal with such situation, descriptive 
programming is used

b)      It is not appropriate in certain scenarios to store the objects inside OR (Object Repository).  Suppose if you want to print 
100 links on the page, you should not store all links in OR. Instead you should use Description Programming to access those links.

'Parameter does not exist'
else
'Parameter exists
end if
99) In QTP explain what is keyword driven automation framework?     

In keyword driven automation framework, the focus is mainly on keywords/functions and not the test data.  It means the complete focus is on 
creating functions which maps the functionality of the application.

102)  What factors affect bitmap checkpoints?

Bitmap checkpoints are affected by screen resolution and image size.

103)  What is Accessibility Checkpoint?

World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) came up with some instructions and guidelines for Web-based technology and information systems to make it 
easy for the disabled to access the web. For example the standards make it mandatory to have an 'alt text' for an image. So a blind person 
who is accessing the website, will use text - to -speech converters and atleast understand what the image is about if not see it. All these 
standards are checked by Accessibility Checkpoints.

1. What is Exploratory Testing?

Exploratory testing is a hands-on approach in which testers are involved in minimum planning and maximum test execution. The planning involves
 the creation of a test charter, a short declaration of the scope of a short (1 to 2 hour) time-boxed test effort, the objectives and possible
 approaches to be used. The test design and test execution activities are performed in parallel typically without formally documenting the test
 conditions, test cases or test scripts. This does not mean that other, more formal testing techniques will not be used. For example, the tester 
 may decide to use boundary value analysis but will think through and test the most important boundary values without necessarily writing them 
 down. Some notes will be written during the exploratory-testing session so that a report can be produced afterward.

2. What is "use case testing"?

In order to identify and execute the functional requirement of an application from start to finish "use case" is used and the techniques used to 
do this is known as "Use Case Testing."

When the presence of one defect hides the presence of another defect in the system, it is known as fault masking.

Example: If the "Negative Value" cause a firing of unhandled system exception, the developer will prevent the negative values 
input. This will resolve the issue and hide the defect of unhandled exception firing.

27. Explain what Test Plan is? What is the information that should be covered in Test Plan?

A test plan can be defined as a document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of testing activities and 
a test plan should cover the following details.

Test Matrix: Test matrix is used to capture actual quality, effort, the plan, resources and time required to capture all 
phases of software testing

Traceability Matrix: Mapping between test cases and customer requirements is known as Traceability Matrix

40. In manual testing what are stubs and drivers?

Both stubs and drivers are part of incremental testing. In incremental testing, there are two approaches namely bottom-up 
and top-down approach. Drivers are used in bottom-up testing and stub is used for a top-down approach. In order to test 
the main module, the stub is used, which is a dummy code or program.

41. What is the step you would follow once you find the defect?

Once a defect is found you would follow the step

a) Recreate the defect

b) Attach the screenshot

c) Log the defect

42. Explain what is "Test Plan Driven" or "Key Word Driven" method of testing?

a) Start of the linear sequence of executable statements

b) End of the linear sequence

c) The target line to which control flow is transferred at the end of the linear sequence

45. Explain what N+1 testing is?

The variation of regression testing is represented as N+1. In this technique, the testing is performed in multiple cycles 
in which errors found in test cycle 'N' are resolved and re-tested in test cycle N+1. The cycle is repeated unless there 
are no errors found.

46. What is Fuzz testing and when it is used?

Fuzz testing is used to detect security loopholes and coding errors in software. In this technique, random data is added 
to the system in an attempt to crash the system. If vulnerability persists, a tool called fuzz tester is used to determine 
potential causes. This technique is more useful for bigger projects but only detects a major fault.

47. Mention what the main advantages of statement coverage metric of software testing are?

The benefit of statement coverage metric is that

a) It does not require processing source code and can be applied directly to object code

b) Bugs are distributed evenly through the code, due to which percentage of executable statements covered reflects the 
percentage of faults discovered

I will talk individually to each person and note their concerns
I will find a solution to the common problems raised by team members
I will hold a team meeting, reveal the solution and ask people to co-operate
50. Mention what are the categories of defects?

Mainly there are three defect categories

Wrong: When a requirement is implemented incorrectly
Missing: It is a variance from the specification, an indication that a specification was not implemented or a requirement 
of the customer is not met
Extra: A requirement incorporated into the product that was not given by the end customer. It is considered as a defect 
because it is a variance from the existing requirements

51. Explain how does a test coverage tool work?

The code coverage testing tool runs parallel while performing testing on the actual product. The code coverage tool 
monitors the executed statements of the source code. When the final testing is done, we get a complete report of the 
pending statements and also get the coverage percentage.

52. Mention what the difference between a "defect" and a "failure" in software testing is?

In simple terms when a defect reaches the end customer, it is called a failure while the defect is identified internally 
and resolved; then it is referred to as a defect.

53. Explain how to test documents in a project that span across the software development lifecycle?

The project span across the software development lifecycle in the following manner

Central/Project test plan: It is the main test plan that outlines the complete test strategy of the project. This plan 
is used till the end of the software development lifecycle
Acceptance test plan: This document begins during the requirement phase and is completed at the final delivery
System test plan: This plan starts during the design plan and proceeds until the end of the project
Integration and Unit test plan: Both these test plans start during the execution phase and last until the final delivery
54. Explain which test cases are written first black boxes or white boxes?

Black box test cases are written first as to write black box test cases; it requires project plan and requirement document 
all these documents are easily available at the beginning of the project. While writing white box test cases requires more 
architectural understanding and is not available at the start of the project.

55. Explain what the difference between latent and masked defects is?

Latent defect: A latent defect is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because the sets of conditions were never 
met
Masked defect: It is an existing defect that has not caused a failure because another defect has prevented that part of the 
code from being executed
56. Mention what bottom-up testing is?

Bottom-up testing is an approach to integration testing, where the lowest level components are tested first, then used to 
facilitate the testing of higher level components. The process is repeated until the component at the top of the hierarchy is tested.

57. Mention what the different types of test coverage techniques are?

Different types of test coverage techniques include

Statement Coverage: It verifies that each line of source code has been executed and tested
Decision Coverage: It ensures that every decision in the source code is executed and tested
Path Coverage: It ensures that every possible route through a given part of the code is executed and tested
58. Mention what the meaning of breath testing is?

Breath testing is a test suite that exercises the full functionality of a product but does not test features in detail

59. Explain what the meaning of Code Walk Through is?

monitoring the output with expected output for correctness.

63. Explain in a testing project what testing activities would you automate?

In testing project testing activities, you would automate are

Tests that need to be run for every build of the application
Tests that use multiple data for the same set of actions
Identical tests that need to be executed using different browsers
Mission critical pages
A transaction with pages that do not change in a short time
64. What is the MAIN benefit of designing tests early in the life cycle?

It helps prevent defects from being introduced into the code.

65. What is risk-based testing?

Risk-based Testing is the term used for an approach to creating a Test Strategy that is based on prioritizing tests by risk. 
The basis of the approach is a detailed risk analysis and prioritizing of risks by risk level. Tests to address each risk 
are then specified, starting with the highest risk first.

66. What is the KEY difference between preventative and reactive approaches to testing?

Preventative tests are designed early; reactive tests are designed after the software has been produced.

67. What is the purpose of exit criteria?

The purpose of exit criteria is to define when a test level is completed.

68. What determines the level of risk?

The likelihood of an adverse event and the impact of the event determine the level of risk.

69. When is used Decision table testing?

Decision table testing is used for testing systems for which the specification takes the form of rules or cause-effect 
combinations. In a decision table, the inputs are listed in a column, with the outputs in the same column but below the 
inputs. The remainder of the table explores combinations of inputs to define the outputs produced.


70. Why we use decision tables?

The techniques of equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are often applied to specific situations or inputs. 
However, if different combinations of inputs result in different actions being taken, this can be more difficult to show 
using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, which tend to be more focused on the user interface. The other 
two specification-based techniques, decision tables, and state transition testing are more focused on business logic or 
business rules. A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of things (e.g., inputs). This technique is 
sometimes also referred to as a 'cause-effect' table. The reason for this is that there is an associated logic diagramming 
technique called 'cause-effect graphing' which was sometimes used to help derive the decision table

71. What is the MAIN objective when reviewing a software deliverable?

To identify defects in any software work product.

72. Which of the following defines the expected results of a test? Test case specification or test design specification.

Test case specification defines the expected results of a test.

73. What is the benefit of test independence?

It avoids author bias in defining effective tests.

74. As part of which test process do you determine the exit criteria?

The exit criteria are determined on the bases of 'Test Planning'.

75. What is Alpha testing?

Pre-release testing by end user representatives at the developer's site.

76. What is beta testing?

Testing performed by potential customers at their own locations.

77. Mention what the difference between Pilot and Beta testing is?

The difference between a pilot and beta testing is that pilot testing is actually done using the product by the group of users 
before the final deployment, and in beta testing, we do not input real data, but it is installed at the end customer to validate 
if the product can be used in production.

78. Given the following fragment of code, how many tests are required for 100% decision coverage?

if width > length 
   thenbiggest_dimension = width
     if height > width 
             thenbiggest_dimension = height 
     end_if
elsebiggest_dimension = length  
            if height > length 
                thenbiggest_dimension = height 
          end_if
end_if
4

79. You have designed test cases to provide 100% statement and 100% decision coverage for the following fragment of code. if 
width > length then biggest_dimension = width else biggest_dimension = length end_if The following has been added to the 
bottom of the code fragment above. print "Biggest dimension is " &biggest_dimensionprint "Width: " & width print "Length: " 
& length How many more test cases are required?

None, existing test cases can be used.

80. What is the difference between Testing Techniques and Testing Tools?

Testing technique: - Is a process for ensuring that some aspects of the application system or unit functions properly there may 
be few techniques but many tools.

Testing Tools: - Is a vehicle for performing a test process. The tool is a resource to the tester, but itself is insufficient 
to conduct testing

ordered. Which of the following groups contain three test inputs that would be generated using Boundary Value Analysis?

4, 5, 99

84. What is component testing?

Component testing, also known as unit, module, and program testing, searches for defects in and verifies the functioning of 
software (e.g., modules, programs, objects, classes, etc.) that are separately testable. Component testing may be done in 
isolation from the rest of the system depending on the context of the development life cycle and the system. Most often stubs 
and drivers are used to replace the missing software and simulate the interface between the software components simply. A 
stub is called from the software component to be tested; a driver calls a component to be tested.


85. What is functional system testing?

Testing the end to end functionality of the system as a whole is defined as a functional system testing.

86. What are the benefits of Independent Testing?

Independent testers are unbiased and identify different defects at the same time.

A 'Test Analysis' and 'Design' includes evaluation of the testability of the requirements and system.

90. What is typically the MOST important reason to use risk to drive testing efforts?

Because testing everything is not feasible.

91. What is random/monkey testing? When is it used?

Random testing is often known as monkey testing. In such type of testing data is generated randomly often using a tool or 
automated mechanism. With this randomly generated input, the system is tested, and results are analyzed accordingly. These 
testing are less reliable; hence it is normally used by the beginners and to see whether the system will hold up under adverse effects.

92. Which of the following are valid objectives for incident reports?

Provide developers and other parties with feedback about the problem to enable identification, isolation, and correction as necessary.
Provide ideas for test process improvement.
Provide a vehicle for assessing tester competence.
Provide testers with a means of tracking the quality of the system under test.
93. Consider the following techniques. Which are static and which are dynamic techniques?

Equivalence Partitioning.
Use Case Testing.
Data Flow Analysis.
Exploratory Testing.
Decision Testing.
Inspections.
Data Flow Analysis and Inspections are static; Equivalence Partitioning, Use Case Testing, Exploratory Testing and Decision Testing are dynamic.

94. Why are static testing and dynamic testing described as complementary?

Because they share the aim of identifying defects but differ in the types of defect they find.

95. What are the phases of a formal review?

In contrast to informal reviews, formal reviews follow a formal process. A typical formal review process consists of six main steps:

Planning
Kick-off
Preparation
Review meeting
Rework
Follow-up.
96. What is the role of moderator in the review process?

The moderator (or review leader) leads the review process. He or she determines, in co-operation with the author, the type of 
review, approach and the composition of the review team. The moderator performs the entry check and the follow-up on the rework, 
in order to control the quality of the input and output of the review process. The moderator also schedules the meeting, disseminates 
documents before the meeting, coaches other team members, paces the meeting, leads possible discussions and stores the data that is collected.


97. What is an equivalence partition (also known as an equivalence class)?

An input or output ranges of values such that only one value in the range becomes a test case.

98. When should configuration management procedures be implemented?

During test planning.

of the target and the test to continue to function properly under these different workloads?

Load Testing

101. Testing activity which is performed to expose defects in the interfaces and in the interaction between integrated components is?

Integration Level Testing

102. What are the Structure-based (white-box) testing techniques?

Structure-based testing techniques (which are also dynamic rather than static) use the internal structure of the software to derive test cases. 
They are commonly called 'white-box' or 'glass-box' techniques (implying you can see into the system) since they require knowledge of how the 
software is implemented, that is, how it works. For example, a structural technique may be concerned with exercising loops in the software. 
Different test cases may be derived to exercise the loop once, twice, and many times. This may be done regardless of the functionality of the software.

103. When should "Regression Testing" be performed?

After the software has changed or when the environment has changed Regression testing should be performed.

104. What is negative and positive testing?

A negative test is when you put in an invalid input and receives errors. While positive testing is when you put in a valid input and expect some 
action to be completed in accordance with the specification.

105. What is the purpose of a test completion criterion?

The purpose of test completion criterion is to determine when to stop testing

106. What can static analysis NOT find?

For example memory leaks.

107. What is the difference between re-testing and regression testing?

Re-testing ensures the original fault has been removed; regression testing looks for unexpected side effects.

108. What are the Experience-based testing techniques?

In experience-based techniques, people's knowledge, skills, and background are a prime contributor to the test conditions and test cases. The 
experience of both technical and business people is important, as they bring different perspectives to the test analysis and design process. 
Due to previous experience with similar systems, they may have insights into what could go wrong, which is very useful for testing.

109. What type of review requires formal entry and exit criteria, including metrics?

Inspection

110. Could reviews or inspections be considered part of testing?

Yes, because both help detects faults and improves quality.

Driver

114. What is the one Key reason why developers have difficulty testing their own work?

Lack of Objectivity

115."How much testing is enough?"

The answer depends on the risk for your industry, contract and special requirements.

116. When should testing be stopped?

It depends on the risks for the system being tested. There are some criteria based on which you can stop testing.

Deadlines (Testing, Release)
Test budget has been depleted
Bug rate fall below a certain level
Test cases completed with certain percentage passed
Alpha or beta periods for testing ends
Coverage of code, functionality or requirements are met to a specified point
117. Which of the following is the primary purpose of the integration strategy for integration testing in the small?

The primary purpose of the integration strategy is to specify which modules to combine when and how many at once.

118. What are semi-random test cases?

Semi-random test cases are nothing, but when we perform random test cases and do equivalence partitioning to those test cases, it removes 
redundant test cases, thus giving us semi-random test cases.

Read p

Read q

IF p+q> 100

THEN Print "Large"

ENDIF

IF p > 50

THEN Print "p Large"

ENDIF

1 test for statement coverage, 2 for branch coverage

120. Which review is normally used to evaluate a product to determine its suitability for the intended use and to identify discrepancies?

Technical Review.

121. Faults found should be originally documented by whom?

By testers.

Author

124. A number of critical bugs are fixed in software. All the bugs are in one module, related to reports. The test manager decides to do 
regression testing only on the reports module.

Regression testing should be done on other modules as well because fixing one module may affect other modules.

125. Why does the boundary value analysis provide good test cases?

Because errors are frequently made during programming of the different cases near the 'edges' of the range of values.

126. What makes an inspection different from other review types?

158. What can be thought of as being based on the project plan, but with greater amounts of detail?

Phase Test Plan

159. What is Rapid Application Development?

Rapid Application Development (RAD) is formally a parallel development of functions and subsequent integration. Components/functions 
are developed in parallel as if they were mini projects, the developments are time-boxed, delivered, and then assembled into a 
working prototype. This can very quickly give the customer something to see and use and to provide feedback regarding the 
delivery and their requirements. Rapid change and development of the product are possible using this methodology. However 
the product specification will need to be developed for the product at some point, and the project will need to be placed under 
more formal controls before going into production.

1) What is the difference between the QA and software testing?

The role of QA (Quality Assurance) is to monitor the quality of the "process" used to produce the software. While the software 
testing, is the process of ensuring the functionality of final product meets the user's requirement.

2) What is Testware?

Testware is test artifacts like test cases, test data, test plans needed to design and execute a test.

3) What is the difference between build and release?

Build: It is a number given to Installable software that is given to the testing team by the development team.

Release: It is a number given to Installable software that is handed over to the customer by the tester or developer.

Bug release is when software or an application is handed over to the testing team knowing that the defect is present in a release.
 During this the priority and severity of bug is low, as bug can be removed before the final handover.

Bug leakage is something, when the bug is discovered by the end users or customer, and not detected by the testing team while 
testing the software.

6) What is data driven testing?

Data driven testing is an automation testing framework, which tests the different input values on the AUT. These values are read 
directly from the data files. The data files may include csv files, excel files, data pools and many more.

7) Explain the steps for Bug Cycle?

Once the bug is identified by the tester, it is assigned to the development manager in open status
If the bug is a valid defect the development team will fix it.
If it is not a valid defect, the defect will be ignored and marked as rejected
The next step will be to check whether it is in scope. If the bug is not the part of the current release then the defects are postponed
If the defect or bug is raised earlier then the tester will assign a DUPLICATE status
When bug is assigned to developer to fix, it will be given a IN-PROGRESS status
Once the defect is repaired, the status will change to FIXED at the end the tester will give CLOSED status if it passes the final test.

1) What is Database Testing?

Database Testing is also known as Backend Testing. Database Testing is segmented into four different categories.

Testing of Data Integrity
Testing of Data Validity
Data base related performance
Testing of functions, procedure and triggers
2) In database testing, what do we need to check normally?

Normally, the things that we check in DB Testing are:

Constraint Check
Validation of a Field size
Stored procedure
Matching application field size to database
Indexes for performance based issues
3) Explain what is data driven test?

In a data-table, to test the multi numbers of data, data-driven test is used. By using this it can easily 
replace the parameters at the same time from different locations.

4) What are joins and mention different types of joins?

Join is used to display two or more than two table and the types of joins are:

Natural Join
Inner Join
Outer Join
Cross Join
The outer join is divided again in two:

Left outer join
Right outer join
5) What are indexes and mention different types of indexes?

Indexes are database objects and they are created on columns. To fetch data quickly they are frequently 
accessed. Different types of indexes are:

B-Tree index
Bitmap index
Clustered index
Covering index
Non-unique index
Unique index
6) While testing stored procedures what are the steps does a tester takes?

The tester will check the standard format of the stored procedures and also it checks the fields are correct 
like updates, joins, indexes, deletions as mentioned in the stored procedure.

7) How would you know for database testing, whether trigger is fired or not?

On querying the common audit log you would know, whether, a trigger is fired or not. It is in audit log 
where you can see the triggers fired.

8) In data base testing, what are the steps to test data loading?

Following steps need to follow to test data loading

Source data should be known
Target data should be known
Compatibility of source and target should be checked
In SQL Enterprise manager, run the DTS package after opening the corresponding DTS package
You have to compare the columns of target and data source
Number of rows of target and source should be checked
After updating data in the source, check whether the changes appears in the target or not.
Check NULLs and junk characters
9) Without using Database Checkpoints, how you test a SQL Query in QTP?

By writing scripting procedure in VBScript, we can connect to database and can test the queries and database.

10) Explain how to use SQL queries in QTP ?

In QTP using output database check point and database check, you have to select the SQL manual queries option. 
After selecting the manual queries option, enter the "select" queries to fetch the data in the database and 
then compare the expected and actual.

11) What is the way of writing testcases for database testing?

Writing a testcases is like functional testing. First you have to know the functional requirement of the 
application. Then you have to decide the parameters for writing testcases like

Objective: Write the objective that you would like to test
Input method: Write the method of action or input you want to execute
Expected: how it should appear in the database
12) To manage and manipulate the test table what are the SQL statements that you have used in Database testing?

The statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE are used to manipulate the table, while ALTER TABLE, 
CREATE TABLE and DELETE TABLE are used to manage table.

13) How to test database procedures and triggers?

To test database procedures and triggers, input and output parameters must be known. EXEC statement can be 
used to run the procedure and examine the behaviour of the tables.

Open the database project in solution explorer
Now in View menu, click the database schema
Open the project folder from schema View menu
Right click on the object that has to be tested, and then click on the dialog box that says Create Unit Tests
After that create a new language test project
Select either a) Insert the unit test or b) Create a new test and then click OK
Project that has to be configured will be done by clicking on the Project Configuration dialog box.
Once it configured click on OK
14) How you can write testcases from requirements and do the requirements represents exact functionality of 
AUT (Application Under Test)?

To write a testcases from requirements, you need to analyse the requirements thoroughly in terms of 
functionality. Thereafter you think about the appropriate testcases design techniques like Equivalence 
partitioning, Black box design, Cause effect graphing etc. for writing the testcases.Yes, the requirements 
represent exact functionality of AUT.

The two types of DCL Commands are:

Grant: By using this command user can access privilege to database

Revoke: By using this command user cannot access the database

18) What is white box testing and black box testing?

Black box testing means testing the software for the outputs on giving particular inputs. This testing is 
usually performed to see if the software meets the user's requirements. There is no specific functional output 
expected for running this test.

The white box testing is done to check the accuracy of code and logic of the program. This testing is done by the 
programmer who knows the logical flow of the system.

19) How does QTP evaluate test results?

Once the testing is done, QTP will generate a report. This report will show the checkpoints, system message and 
error that were detected while testing. The test results window will show any mismatches encountered at the checkpoints.

20) Explain the QTP testing process?

QTP testing process is based on following steps:
Creating GUI (Graphical User Interface) Map files : Identifies the GUI object which has to be tested
Creating test scripts: Test scripts are recorded
Debug tests: Test should be debugged
Run tests: Testcases should be run.
View results: The results reflects the success or failure of the tests
Report detects: If the test is failed, the reasons will be recorded in the report detect file
21) What is load testing and give some examples of it?

To measure the system response, load testing is done. If the load exceeds the users pattern it is known as stress 
testing. Examples of load testing are downloading the set of large files, executing multiple applications on a single 
computer, subjecting a server to large number of e-mails and allotting many tasks to a printer one after another.

22) How to test database manually?

Testing the database manually involves checking the data at the back end and to see whether the addition of data in 
front end is affecting the back end or not, and same for delete, update, insert etc.

To define database structure, a Developer uses DDL. DDL stands for Data Definition Language. The various DDL commands 
include Create, Truncate, Drop, Alter, Comment and Rename.

<b id="GN__webservices_interview_questions:">GN__webservices_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

1) Define Web Service?

A web service is a kind of software that is accessible on the Internet. It makes use of the XML messaging system and offers 
an easy to understand, interface for the end users.

2) What is new in this field for past few years?

The initiation of XML in this field is the advancement that provides web service a single language to communicate in between 
the RPCs, web services and their directories.

3) Give me an example of real web service?

One example of web services is IBM Web Services browser. You can get it from IBM Alphaworks site. This browser shows various 
demos related to web services. Basically web services can be used with the help of SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI . All these, provide 
a plug-and-play interface for using web services such as stock-quote service, a traffic-report service, weather service etc.

4) How you define web service protocol stack?

It is basically set of various protocols that can be used to explore and execute web services. The entire stack has four layers 
i.e. Service Transport, XML Messaging, Service Description and Service Discovery.

5) Can you define each of these layers of protocol stack?

The Service Transport layer transfer messages between different applications, such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and Blocks Extensible 
Exchange Protocol (BEEP). The XML Messaging layer encodes messages in XML format so that messages can be understood at each end, 
such as XML-RPC and SOAP. The Service Description layer describes the user interface to a web service, such as WSDL. The Service 
Discovery layer centralizes services to a common registry and offer simple publish functionality, such as UDDI.

6) Define XML - RPC?

It is a protocol that makes use of XML messages to do Remote Procedure Calls.

7) Define SOAP?

SOAP is an XML based protocol to transfer between computers.

8) Define WSDL?

It means Web Services Description Language. It is basically the service description layer in the web service protocol stock. The 
Service Description layer describes the user interface to a web service.

9) What kind of security is needed for web services?

The security level for web services should be more than that of what we say Secure Socket Layer (SSL). This level of security can 
be only achieved from Entrust Secure Transaction Platform. Web services need this level of security to ensure reliable transactions 
and secure confidential information .

10) Do you have any idea about foundation security services?

As implies from its name, these services are the foundation or basics of integration, authentication, authorization, digital 
signatures and encryption processes.

11) Define Entrust Identification Service?

Entrust Identification Service comes from the Entrust Security Transaction Platform. This platform allows companies to control the 
identities that are trusted to perform transactions for Web services transactions.

12) What UDDI means?

UDDI stands for Universal, Description, Discovery, and Integration. It is the discovery layer in the web services protocol stack.

13) Define Entrust Entitlements Service?

This service verifies entities that attempt to access a web service. For Example, the authentication service, the Entitlements Service 
ensures security in business operations.

14) Define Entrust Privacy Service?

As its name implies, it deals with security and confidentiality. This service encrypts data to ensure that only concerned parties 
can access the data.

15) What do you mean by PKI?

It means Public-Key Infrastructure.

16) What tools are used to test a web service?

I have used SoapUI for SOAP WS and Firefox poster plugin for RESTFul Services.

17) Differentiate between a SOA and a Web service?

SOA is a design and architecture to implement other services. SOA can be easily implemented using various protocols such as HTTP, 
HTTPS, JMS, SMTP, RMI, IIOP, RPC etc. While Web service, itself is an implemented technology. In fact one can implement SOA using the web service.

18) Discuss various approaches to develop SOAP based web service?

We can develop SOAP based web service with two different types of approaches such as contract-first and contract-last. In the first 
approach, the contract is defined first and then the classes are derived from the contract while in the later one, the classes are defined 
first and then the contract is derived from these classes.

19) If you have to choose one approach, then what will be your choice?

In my point of view, the first approach that is the contract-first approach is more feasible as compared to the second one but still it 
depends on other factors too.

20) Is there any special application required to access web service?

No, you don't need to install any special application to access web service. You can access web service from any application that supports 
XML based object request and response.

21) Can you name few free and commercial implementations for web services?

The implementations I know are Apache SOAP, JAX-WS Reference Implementation, JAX-RS Reference Implementation, Metro, Apache CXF, MS.NET and Java 6.

22) Name browser that allows access to web service?

JavaScript XmlHttpRequest object is required to access web service via browsers. The browsers that support this object are Internet 
Explorer, Safari and Mozilla-based browsers like FireFox.

23) What is REST?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST itself is not a standard, while it uses various standards such as HTTP, URL, 
XML/HTML/GIF/JPEG (Resource Representations) and text/xml, text/html, image/gif, image/jpeg, etc (MIME Types).

24) How one can provide API to users?

To provide an API to the users, one can easily do this with an "open table". All you need to do is to write open table which is basically an 
XML schema that point to a web service.

25) Name the various communication channels in web service?

Web service is integrated with three protocols such as HTTP/POST, HTTP/GET, and SOAP. It provides three different communication channels to 
clients. Client can choose any communication method as per requirements.

26) How can you document web service?

Web services are contemplated as self-documenting because they provide entire information regarding the available methods and parameters used 
for XML based standard, known as WSDL. One can also provide more information to explain web services via their own WebService and WebMethod attributes.

27) What are the situations, when we need ASP.NET web services?

ASP.NET web services are used when one need to implement three tier architecture in a web service. It allows handy ways to use middle tier 
components through internet. The main advantage of .NET Web services is that they are capable enough to communicate across firewalls because 
they use SOAP as transport protocol.

28) What are distributed technologies?

The increasing ratio of distributed applications has raised demand for distributed technologies. It allows segmenting of application units and 
transferring them to different computers on different networks.

29) Differentiate between web services, CORBA and DCOM?

Web services transfer/receive messages to/from application respectively, via HTTP protocol. It uses XML to encode data.

CORBA and DCOM transfer/receive messages to/from application respectively, via non-standard protocols such as IIOP and RPC.

30) Can you tell few benefits of web services?

The biggest advantage of web service is that is supported by wide variety of platforms. Moreover, in near future, web services may spread its 
boundary and enhance new methods that will provide ease to clients. The enhancement will not affect the clients, even if they offer old methods 
and parameters.

31) Can you name some standards used in web services?

The standards used in web services are WSDL (used to create interface definition), SOAP (used to structure data), HTTP (communication channels), 
DISCO (used to create discovery documents) and UDDI (used to create business registries).

32) Explain in brief, what DISCO is?

DISCO means discovery. It groups the list of interrelated web services. The organization that provides web services, issues a DISCO file on its
 server and that file contains the links of all the provided web services. This standard is good when client knows the company already. Also it 
 can be used within a local network as well.

33) Explain in brief, what UDDI is?

UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) provides consolidated directory for web services on the internet. Clients use UDDI to find
 web services as per their business needs. It basically hosts the web services from various companies. In order to share web services, you need to 
 publish it in UDDI.

34) Explain the .NET web services supported data types?

.Net web services uses XML-based standards to transfer/receive information. Thus, .NET web services can only works with data types known by XML 
schema standard. Like FileSteam, Eventlog etc. are not recognized by the XML schema standards and hence, not supported in web services.

35) How a .NET web service is tested?

ASP.NET uses a test page routinely, when one calls for the URL of .asmx file in any browser. This page shows complete information regarding web services.

36) How a .NET web service is consumed?

Since we know that web services are constructed on XML standards. Therefore, clients need to have complete understanding of XML-based messages to 
interchange messages. Clients can communicate with web services through .NET framework that offers proxy mechanisms. These proxy mechanisms have 
detailed information regarding data sharing within web services that can be easily used by the clients.

37) Can you name the two Microsoft solutions for distributed applications?

The two Microsoft solutions for distributed applications are .NET Web Services and .NET Remoting.

38) Differentiate between .NET Web Services and .NET Remoting?

As far as protocol is concerned, .NET Web Service uses HTTP, while, .NET Remoting uses any protocol i.e. TCP/HTTP/SMTP. When it comes to performance, 
.NET Remoting is comparatively, faster than.NET Web Service. Also, as .NET Web Services are hosted via IIS, therefore, it is far more reliable than 
the .NET Remoting.

39) Name the components to be published while deploying a Web Service?

The components that need to be published during a web service deployment are Web Application Directory, Webservice.asmx File, Webservice.Disco File, 
Web.Config File and Bin Directory.

40) What are the steps performed by the client to access a web service?

First of all a web reference to the web service is created by the client in his application. Then a proxy class is generated. After that an object of 
the proxy class is created and at last, the web service is accessed via that proxy object.

41) How web services are implemented in .NET?

To implement web services in .NET, HTTP handlers are used that interrupt requests to .asmx files.

42) Explain few disadvantages of Response Caching?

Response Caching is useless or incompetent when method accepts extensive amount of values because caching means to store lot of information. Also, 
if the method depends on external source of information, and that are not provided within the parameters then such methods are bypassed.

43) What is the alternate solution to Response Caching?

One can use Data Caching (System.Web.Caching.Cach) instead of Response Caching.

44) Brief few drawbacks of using GET and POST methods to communicate with the web service?

These methods are less secure and inhibit users to pass structures and objects as arguments. Also, it doesn't allow users to pass ByRef arguments.

45) How can one access a class as a web service?

To access a class as a web service, one should inherit the class from the System.Web.Services.WebService class and qualify the class with the 
WebService attribute.

46) How can one access the web service class method via internet?

To access web service class method via internet, one should qualify a method with the WebMethod attribute.

47) How a SOAP message is structured?

A SOAP message is consists of SOAP Envelope, SOAP Headers, and SOAP Body.

48) Can you name different kinds of web services?

There are two types of web services in total i.e. SOAP based web service and RESTful web service.

This question is already mentioned earlier.

49) What's different in RESTful web services?

JAXP is a JAVA API for XML processing that enables application to write, read, manipulate and transform XML data. Similarly, to perform other 
various function there are other Java API's as well like JAX-RPC, JAXM, JAXR, JAXB, etc.

53) Mention the JAXB binding framework?

JAXB binding framework is available in three Java Packages

xml.bind: This package defines abstract classes and interfaces that are used directly with content classes
xml.bind.util: This package contains utility classes that may be availed by client applications to manage marshalling, unmarshalling and 
validation events
xml.bind.helper: This helper package gives partial implementations for some of the javax.xml.bind interfaces. These APIs are not to be directly 
used by applications using JAXB architecture
54) Give a simple example of how XML document can be Marshal and Unmarshal in JAVA framework?

Marshalling is the process of converting XML document into Java readable form while UnMarshalling is the reverse process of Marshalling. Let see 
how Java unmarshals an XML document and then marshals it back

JAXBContext jc= JAXBContext.newInstance ("com.acme.foo");

// unmarshal from foo.xml

Unmarshaller u = jc.createUnmarshaller () ;

FooObject fooObj=

(FooObject)u.unmarshal (new File ("foo.xml") );

// marshal to sytem.out

Marshaller m = jc.createMarshaller ();

m.marshal (fooObj, System.out);

55) Explain what does Marshaller do if jaxb.encoding property is not declared?

By default, the Marshaller will use "UTF-8" if jaxb.encoding property is not declared.

56) Mention what are the types of validation can a JAXB client can perform?

There are two types of JAXB client validation that a JAXB can perform

Unmarshal Time Validation
On-Demand Validation
57) Mention what are the three ways to handle the event encountered during the marshal, unmarshal and validate operations?

Using the default event handler
Register and Implement a custom event handler
Use the ValidationEventCollector utility
58) Explain where does JAXB compiler is located?

JAXB schema binding compiler is placed in the <JWSDP_Home>/jaxb/bin directory. In this directory, there are two scripts, xjc.sh (Solaris/Linux) 
and xjc.bat (Windows).

59) In what cases do you need to customize the default binding?

In some cases, you are required to customize the default binding like

Creating API documentation for the schema derived JAXB packages, classes, methods and constants
Giving semantically meaningful customized names for cases that the default XML name-to-Java identifier mapping cannot handle automatically
Overriding default binding- like specifying that a model group should be attached to a class rather than a list
60) Explain what is Inline Customization?

Customization to JAXB bindings made by means of inline binding declarations in an XML schema file that take the form of <xsd:appinfo> elements 
embedded in schema <xsd:annotation>elements.

61) Explain what is XML signature?

XML can be used to sign any arbitrary data whether it is a binary or XML. The data is recognized via URIs in one or more reference elements. It 
is described in one or more forms, like detached, enveloping or enveloped.

62) Explain what is Stax?

Stax stands for Streaming API for XML; it is an API to read and write XML documents, originating from the JAVA programming language.

63) Mention what are the usual XML APIs?

The usual XML APIs includes

DOM based or Tree based APIs: The whole document is read into memory as a tree structure for random availability by calling application
Event based APIs: The application registers to get events as entities are encountered within the source document
64) Explain what is Push parsing and Pull parsing?

Pull Parsing: Streaming pull parsing is referred to a programming model in which a client application calls methods on an XML parsing library, when 
it needed to communicate with an XML infoset- which means the client will only gets XML data when it is asked for
Push Parsing: In Push Parsing, the parser pushes parsing events or XML data to the application. In push model, the parser got the hold over the 
parsing process and the parser calls the implemented handler methods.
65) Explain on which technology does XWS security is based on? List out the options that XWS security provides for securing JAX-RPC applications?

68) Explain what does the JAXR architecture consist of?

JAXR architecture is consists of a JAXR client and JAXR provider.

JAXR client: It is a client program which uses the JAXR API to use a registry through a JAXR provider
JAXR provider: It is an implementation of the JAXR API that provide access to a particular registry provider or to a class of registry providers 
that are built on a common speicifications.
69) Explain what is JAXM messaging models?

There are two types of messaging models for JAXM synchronous and asynchronous

Synchronous messaging model: In such type of model, client directly communicates with the source. In this, the client will send the request and waits.
Asynchronous messaging model: In this model, client directs the message to the messaging provider and returns back. Messaging provider then executes 
the routing of the message to the end source.
70) Explain what is UDDI, DISCO and WSDL?

UDDI: It means Universal Description, Discovery and I It is the directory that is used to publish and discover public web services
DISCO: It is commonly known as discovery. It clubs common services together and exposes schemas document of the web services
WSDL: It stands for web service description language (WSDL). It is used to describe web services. The description includes URL of web services, 
properties and methods supported by web services, data type it supports and protocol detail it supports

it is possible by using AND function.

Example: If you have two cells, A1 and A2, and the value you put in those two cells are >5 and you want result should display as 'TRUE' in cell B1 if 
value>5, and 'False' if any of those values<5. You can use AND function to do that.

41) How cell reference is useful in the calculation?

In order to avoid writing the data again and again for calculating purpose, cell reference is used. When you write any formula, for specific function, 
you need to direct Excel the specific location of that data. This location is referred as, cell reference. So, every time a new value added to the cell, 
the cell will calculate according to the reference cell formula.

1. What is DBMS?

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a program that controls creation, maintenance and use of a database. DBMS can be termed as File
 Manager that manages data in a database rather than saving it in file systems.

2. What is RDBMS?

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS store the data into the collection of tables, which is related by common 
fields between the columns of the table. It also provides relational operators to manipulate the data stored into the tables.

Example: SQL Server.

3. What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language , and it is used to communicate with the Database. This is a standard language used to perform 
tasks such as retrieval, updation, insertion and deletion of data from a database.

Standard SQL Commands are Select.

4. What is a Database?

Database is nothing but an organized form of data for easy access, storing, retrieval and managing of data. This is also known as structured
 form of data which can be accessed in many ways.

Example: School Management Database, Bank Management Database.

5. What are tables and Fields?

A table is a set of data that are organized in a model with Columns and Rows. Columns can be categorized as vertical, and Rows are horizontal.
 A table has specified number of column called fields but can have any number of rows which is called record.

Example:.

Table: Employee.

Field: Emp ID, Emp Name, Date of Birth.

Data: 201456, David, 11/15/1960.

6. What is a primary key?

A primary key is a combination of fields which uniquely specify a row. This is a special kind of unique key, and it has implicit NOT NULL 
constraint. It means, Primary key values cannot be NULL.

7. What is a unique key?

A Unique key constraint uniquely identified each record in the database. This provides uniqueness for the column or set of columns.

A Primary key constraint has automatic unique constraint defined on it. But not, in the case of Unique Key.

There can be many unique constraint defined per table, but only one Primary key constraint defined per table.

8. What is a foreign key?

A foreign key is one table which can be related to the primary key of another table. Relationship needs to be created between two tables
 by referencing foreign key with the primary key of another table.

9. What is a join?

This is a keyword used to query data from more tables based on the relationship between the fields of the tables. Keys play a major role 
when JOINs are used.

10. What are the types of join and explain each?

There are various types of join which can be used to retrieve data and it depends on the relationship between tables.

Inner Join.
Inner join return rows when there is at least one match of rows between the tables.

Right Join.
Right join return rows which are common between the tables and all rows of Right hand side table. Simply, it returns all the rows from 
the right hand side table even though there are no matches in the left hand side table.

Left Join.
Left join return rows which are common between the tables and all rows of Left hand side table. Simply, it returns all the rows from Left
 hand side table even though there are no matches in the Right hand side table.

Full Join.
Full join return rows when there are matching rows in any one of the tables. This means, it returns all the rows from the left hand side 
table and all the rows from the right hand side table.

11. What is normalization?

Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy and dependency by organizing fields and table of a database. The main aim of Normalization
 is to add, delete or modify field that can be made in a single table.

12. What is Denormalization.

DeNormalization is a technique used to access the data from higher to lower normal forms of database. It is also process of introducing 
redundancy into a table by incorporating data from the related tables.

13. What are all the different normalizations?

The normal forms can be divided into 5 forms, and they are explained below -.

First Normal Form (1NF):.
This should remove all the duplicate columns from the table. Creation of tables for the related data and identification of unique columns.

Second Normal Form (2NF):.
Meeting all requirements of the first normal form. Placing the subsets of data in separate tables and Creation of relationships between the tables
 using primary keys.

Third Normal Form (3NF):.
This should meet all requirements of 2NF. Removing the columns which are not dependent on primary key constraints.

Fourth Normal Form (4NF):.
Meeting all the requirements of third normal form and it should not have multi- valued dependencies.

14. What is a View?

A view is a virtual table which consists of a subset of data contained in a table. Views are not virtually present, and it takes less space to store.
 View can have data of one or more tables combined, and it is depending on the relationship.

15. What is an Index?

An index is performance tuning method of allowing faster retrieval of records from the table. An index creates an entry for each value and it 
will be faster to retrieve data.

16. What are all the different types of indexes?

There are three types of indexes -.

Unique Index.
This indexing does not allow the field to have duplicate values if the column is unique indexed. Unique index can be applied automatically when
 primary key is defined.

Clustered Index.
This type of index reorders the physical order of the table and search based on the key values. Each table can have only one clustered index.

NonClustered Index.
NonClustered Index does not alter the physical order of the table and maintains logical order of data. Each table can have 999 nonclustered indexes.

17. What is a Cursor?

A database Cursor is a control which enables traversal over the rows or records in the table. This can be viewed as a pointer to one row in a set
 of rows. Cursor is very much useful for traversing such as retrieval, addition and removal of database records.

18. What is a relationship and what are they?

Database Relationship is defined as the connection between the tables in a database. There are various data basing relationships, and they are as follows:.

One to One Relationship.
One to Many Relationship.
Many to One Relationship.
Self-Referencing Relationship.
19. What is a query?

A DB query is a code written in order to get the information back from the database. Query can be designed in such a way that it matched with our
 expectation of the result set. Simply, a question to the Database.

20. What is subquery?

A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is called as main query, and inner query is called subquery. SubQuery is always executed
 first, and the result of subquery is passed on to the main query.

21. What are the types of subquery?

There are two types of subquery - Correlated and Non-Correlated.

A correlated subquery cannot be considered as independent query, but it can refer the column in a table listed in the FROM the list of the main query.

A Non-Correlated sub query can be considered as independent query and the output of subquery are substituted in the main query.

22. What is a stored procedure?

Stored Procedure is a function consists of many SQL statement to access the database system. Several SQL statements are consolidated into a stored 
procedure and execute them whenever and wherever required.

23. What is a trigger?

A DB trigger is a code or programs that automatically execute with response to some event on a table or view in a database. Mainly, trigger helps 
to maintain the integrity of the database.

Example: When a new student is added to the student database, new records should be created in the related tables like Exam, Score and Attendance tables.

24. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE commands?

DELETE command is used to remove rows from the table, and WHERE clause can be used for conditional set of parameters. Commit and Rollback can be
 performed after delete statement.

TRUNCATE removes all rows from the table. Truncate operation cannot be rolled back.

25. What are local and global variables and their differences?

Local variables are the variables which can be used or exist inside the function. They are not known to the other functions and those variables
 cannot be referred or used. Variables can be created whenever that function is called.

Global variables are the variables which can be used or exist throughout the program. Same variable declared in global cannot be used in functions.
 Global variables cannot be created whenever that function is called.

26. What is a constraint?

Constraint can be used to specify the limit on the data type of table. Constraint can be specified while creating or altering the table statement.
 Sample of constraint are.

NOT NULL.
CHECK.
DEFAULT.
UNIQUE.
PRIMARY KEY.
FOREIGN KEY.
27. What is data Integrity?

Data Integrity defines the accuracy and consistency of data stored in a database. It can also define integrity constraints to enforce business
 rules on the data when it is entered into the application or database.

28. What is Auto Increment?

Auto increment keyword allows the user to create a unique number to be generated when a new record is inserted into the table. AUTO INCREMENT
 keyword can be used in Oracle and IDENTITY keyword can be used in SQL SERVER.

Mostly this keyword can be used whenever PRIMARY KEY is used.

29. What is the difference between Cluster and Non-Cluster Index?

Clustered index is used for easy retrieval of data from the database by altering the way that the records are stored. Database sorts out rows
 by the column which is set to be clustered index.

A nonclustered index does not alter the way it was stored but creates a complete separate object within the table. It point back to the original
 table rows after searching.

30. What is Datawarehouse?

Datawarehouse is a central repository of data from multiple sources of information. Those data are consolidated, transformed and made available
 for the mining and online processing. Warehouse data have a subset of data called Data Marts.

31. What is Self-Join?

Self-join is set to be query used to compare to itself. This is used to compare values in a column with other values in the same column in the 
same table. ALIAS ES can be used for the same table comparison.

32. What is Cross-Join?

Cross join defines as Cartesian product where number of rows in the first table multiplied by number of rows in the second table. If suppose, 
WHERE clause is used in cross join then the query will work like an INNER JOIN.

33. What is user defined functions?

User defined functions are the functions written to use that logic whenever required. It is not necessary to write the same logic several times.
 Instead, function can be called or executed whenever needed.

34. What are all types of user defined functions?

Three types of user defined functions are.

Scalar Functions.
Inline Table valued functions.
Multi statement valued functions.
Scalar returns unit, variant defined the return clause. Other two types return table as a return.

35. What is collation?

Collation is defined as set of rules that determine how character data can be sorted and compared. This can be used to compare A and, other 
language characters and also depends on the width of the characters.

Following are different types of collation sensitivity -.

Case Sensitivity - A and a and B and b.
Accent Sensitivity.
Kana Sensitivity - Japanese Kana characters.
Width Sensitivity - Single byte character and double byte character.
37. Advantages and Disadvantages of Stored Procedure?

Stored procedure can be used as a modular programming - means create once, store and call for several times whenever required. This supports
 faster execution instead of executing multiple queries. This reduces network traffic and provides better security to the data.

Disadvantage is that it can be executed only in the Database and utilizes more memory in the database server.

38. What is Online Transaction Processing (OLTP)?

Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) manages transaction based applications which can be used for data entry, data retrieval and data processing.
 OLTP makes data management simple and efficient. Unlike OLAP systems goal of OLTP systems is serving real-time transactions.

Example - Bank Transactions on a daily basis.

39. What is CLAUSE?

SQL clause is defined to limit the result set by providing condition to the query. This usually filters some rows from the whole set of records.

Example - Query that has WHERE condition

Query that has HAVING condition.

40. What is recursive stored procedure?

A stored procedure which calls by itself until it reaches some boundary condition. This recursive function or procedure helps programmers to use
 the same set of code any number of times.

41. What is Union, minus and Interact commands?

UNION operator is used to combine the results of two tables, and it eliminates duplicate rows from the tables.

MINUS operator is used to return rows from the first query but not from the second query. Matching records of first and second query and other 
rows from the first query will be displayed as a result set.

INTERSECT operator is used to return rows returned by both the queries.

42. What is an ALIAS command?

ALIAS name can be given to a table or column. This alias name can be referred in WHERE clause to identify the table or column.

Example-.

Select st.StudentID, Ex.Result from student st, Exam as Ex where st.studentID = Ex. StudentID
Here, st refers to alias name for student table and Ex refers to alias name for exam table.

43. What is the difference between TRUNCATE and DROP statements?

TRUNCATE removes all the rows from the table, and it cannot be rolled back. DROP command removes a table from the database and operation cannot
 be rolled back.

44. What are aggregate and scalar functions?

Aggregate functions are used to evaluate mathematical calculation and return single values. This can be calculated from the columns in a table.
 Scalar functions return a single value based on the input value.

Example -.

Aggregate - max(), count - Calculated with respect to numeric.

Scalar - UCASE(), NOW() - Calculated with respect to strings.

45. How can you create an empty table from an existing table?

Example will be -.

Select * into studentcopy from student where 1=2
Here, we are copying student table to another table with the same structure with no rows copied.

46. How to fetch common records from two tables?

Common records result set can be achieved by -.

Select studentID from student. <strong>INTERSECT </strong> Select StudentID from Exam
47. How to fetch alternate records from a table?

Records can be fetched for both Odd and Even row numbers -.

To display odd numbers-.

Select studentId from (Select rowno, studentId from student) where mod(rowno,2)=1
from (Select rowno, studentId from student) where mod(rowno,2)=1.[/sql]

48. How to select unique records from a table?

Select unique records from a table by using DISTINCT keyword.

Select DISTINCT StudentID, StudentName from Student.
49. What is the command used to fetch first 5 characters of the string?

There are many ways to fetch first 5 characters of the string -.

<b id="GN__plsql_interview_questions:">GN__plsql_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>  

1) What is PL SQL ?

PL SQL is a procedural language which has interactive SQL, as well as procedural programming language constructs like conditional 
branching and iteration.

2) Differentiate between % ROWTYPE and TYPE RECORD.

% ROWTYPE is used when a query returns an entire row of a table or view.

TYPE RECORD, on the other hand, is used when a query returns column of different tables or views.

Eg. TYPE r_emp is RECORD (sno smp.smpno%type,sname smp sname %type)

e_rec smp %ROWTYPE

Cursor c1 is select smpno,dept from smp;

e_rec c1 %ROWTYPE

3) Explain uses of cursor.

Cursor is a named private area in SQL from which information can be accessed. They are required to process each row individually 
for queries which return multiple rows.

4) Show code of a cursor for loop.

Cursor declares %ROWTYPE as loop index implicitly. It then opens a cursor, gets rows of values from the active set in fields of the 
record and shuts when all records are processed.

Eg. FOR smp_rec IN C1 LOOP

totalsal=totalsal+smp_recsal;

ENDLOOP;

5) Explain the uses of database trigger.

A PL/SQL program unit associated with a particular database table is called a database trigger. It is used for :

1) Audit data modifications.

2) Log events transparently.

3) Enforce complex business rules.

4) Maintain replica tables

5) Derive column values

6) Implement Complex security authorizations

6) What are the two types of exceptions.

Error handling part of PL/SQL block is called Exception. They have two types : user_defined and predefined.

7) Show some predefined exceptions.

DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX

ZERO_DIVIDE

NO_DATA_FOUND

TOO_MANY_ROWS

CURSOR_ALREADY_OPEN

INVALID_NUMBER

INVALID_CURSOR

PROGRAM_ERROR

TIMEOUT _ON_RESOURCE

STORAGE_ERROR

LOGON_DENIED

VALUE_ERROR

etc.

8) Explain Raise_application_error.

It is a procedure of package DBMS_STANDARD that allows issuing of user_defined error messages from database trigger or stored sub-program.

9) Show how functions and procedures are called in a PL SQL block.

Function is called as a part of an expression.

total:=calculate_sal('b644')

Procedure is called as a statement in PL/SQL.

calculate_bonus('b644');

10) Explain two virtual tables available at the time of database trigger execution.

Table columns are referred as THEN.column_name and NOW.column_name.

For INSERT related triggers, NOW.column_name values are available only.

For DELETE related triggers, THEN.column_name values are available only.

For UPDATE related triggers, both Table columns are available.

11) What are the rules to be applied to NULLs whilst doing comparisons?

1) NULL is never TRUE or FALSE

2) NULL cannot be equal or unequal to other values

3) If a value in an expression is NULL, then the expression itself evaluates to NULL except for concatenation operator (||)

12) How is a process of PL SQL compiled?

Compilation process includes syntax check, bind and p-code generation processes.

Syntax checking checks the PL SQL codes for compilation errors. When all errors are corrected, a storage address is assigned to the 
variables that hold data. It is called Binding. P-code is a list of instructions for the PL SQL engine. P-code is stored in the 
database for named blocks and is used the next time it is executed.

13) Differentiate between Syntax and runtime errors.

A syntax error can be easily detected by a PL/SQL compiler. For eg, incorrect spelling.

A runtime error is handled with the help of exception-handling section in an PL/SQL block. For eg, SELECT INTO statement, which does not return any rows.

14) Explain Commit, Rollback and Savepoint.

For a COMMIT statement, the following is true:

Other users can see the data changes made by the transaction.
The locks acquired by the transaction are released.
The work done by the transaction becomes permanent.
A ROLLBACK statement gets issued when the transaction ends, and the following is true.

The work done in a transition is undone as if it was never issued.
All locks acquired by transaction are released.
It undoes all the work done by the user in a transaction. With SAVEPOINT, only part of transaction can be undone.

15) Define Implicit and Explicit Cursors.

A cursor is implicit by default. The user cannot control or process the information in this cursor.

If a query returns multiple rows of data, the program defines an explicit cursor. This allows the application to process each row 
sequentially as the cursor returns it.

16) Explain mutating table error.

It occurs when a trigger tries to update a row that it is currently using. It is fixed by using views or temporary tables, so database
 selects one and updates the other.

17) When is a declare statement required?

DECLARE statement is used by PL SQL anonymous blocks such as with stand alone, non-stored procedures. If it is used, it must come first in a stand alone file.

18) How many triggers can be applied to a table?

A maximum of 12 triggers can be applied to one table.

19) What is the importance of SQLCODE and SQLERRM?

SQLCODE returns the value of the number of error for the last encountered error whereas SQLERRM returns the message for the last error.

20) If a cursor is open, how can we find in a PL SQL Block?

the %ISOPEN cursor status variable can be used.

21) Show the two PL/SQL cursor exceptions.

Cursor_Already_Open

Invaid_cursor

22) What operators deal with NULL?

NVL converts NULL to another specified value.

var:=NVL(var2,'Hi');

IS NULL and IS NOT NULL can be used to check specifically to see whether the value of a variable is NULL or not.

23) Does SQL*Plus also have a PL/SQL Engine?

No, SQL*Plus does not have a PL/SQL Engine embedded in it. Thus, all PL/SQL code is sent directly to database engine. It is much more 
efficient as each statement is not individually stripped off.

24) What packages are available to PL SQL developers?

DBMS_ series of packages, such as, DBMS_PIPE, DBMS_DDL, DBMS_LOCK, DBMS_ALERT, DBMS_OUTPUT, DBMS_JOB, DBMS_UTILITY, DBMS_SQL, DBMS_TRANSACTION, UTL_FILE.

25) Explain 3 basic parts of a trigger.

A triggering statement or event.
A restriction
An action
26) What are character functions?

INITCAP, UPPER, SUBSTR, LOWER and LENGTH are all character functions. Group functions give results based on groups of rows, as opposed 
to individual rows. They are MAX, MIN, AVG, COUNT and SUM.

27) Explain TTITLE and BTITLE.

TTITLE and BTITLE commands that control report headers and footers.

28) Show the cursor attributes of PL/SQL.

%ISOPEN : Checks if the cursor is open or not

%ROWCOUNT : The number of rows that are updated, deleted or fetched.

%FOUND : Checks if the cursor has fetched any row. It is true if rows are fetched

%NOT FOUND : Checks if the cursor has fetched any row. It is True if rows are not fetched.

29) What is an Intersect?

Intersect is the product of two tables and it lists only matching rows.

30) What are sequences?

Sequences are used to generate sequence numbers without an overhead of locking. Its drawback is that the sequence number is lost if 
the transaction is rolled back.

31) How would you reference column values BEFORE and AFTER you have inserted and deleted triggers?

Using the keyword "new.column name", the triggers can reference column values by new collection. By using the keyword "old.column name", 
they can reference column vaues by old collection.

32) What are the uses of SYSDATE and USER keywords?

SYSDATE refers to the current server system date. It is a pseudo column. USER is also a pseudo column but refers to current user logged
 onto the session. They are used to monitor changes happening in the table.

33) How does ROWID help in running a query faster?

ROWID is the logical address of a row, it is not a physical column. It composes of data block number, file number and row number in the 
data block. Thus, I/O time gets minimized retrieving the row, and results in a faster query.

34) What are database links used for?

Database links are created in order to form communication between various databases, or different environments like test, development 
and production. The database links are read-only to access other information as well.

35) What does fetching a cursor do?

Fetching a cursor reads Result Set row by row.

36) What does closing a cursor do?

Closing a cursor clears the private SQL area as well as de-allocates memory

37) Explain the uses of Control File.

It is a binary file. It records the structure of the database. It includes locations of several log files, names and timestamps. They
 can be stored in different locations to help in retrieval of information if one file gets corrupted.

38) Explain Consistency

Consistency shows that data will not be reflected to other users until the data is commit, so that consistency is maintained.

39) Differ between Anonymous blocks and sub-programs.

Anonymous blocks are unnamed blocks that are not stored anywhere whilst sub-programs are compiled and stored in database. They are compiled at runtime.

40) Differ between DECODE and CASE.

DECODE and CASE statements are very similar, but CASE is extended version of DECODE. DECODE does not allow Decision making statements in its place.

select decode(totalsal=12000,'high',10000,'medium') as decode_tesr from smp where smpno in (10,12,14,16);

This statement returns an error.

CASE is directly used in PL SQL, but DECODE is used in PL SQL through SQL only.

41) Explain autonomous transaction.

An autonomous transaction is an independent transaction of the main or parent transaction. It is not nested if it is started by another transaction.

There are several situations to use autonomous transactions like event logging and auditing.

42) Differentiate between SGA and PGA.

SGA stands for System Global Area whereas PGA stands for Program or Process Global Area. PGA is only allocated 10% RAM size, but SGA is given 40% RAM size.

43) What is the location of Pre_defined_functions.

They are stored in the standard package called "Functions, Procedures and Packages"

44) Explain polymorphism in PL SQL.

Polymorphism is a feature of OOP. It is the ability to create a variable, an object or function with multiple forms. PL/SQL supports 
Polymorphism in the form of program unit overloading inside a member function or package..Unambiguous logic must be avoided whilst overloading is being done.

45) What are the uses of MERGE?

MERGE is used to combine multiple DML statements into one.

Syntax : merge into tablename

using(query)

on(join condition)

when not matched then

[insert/update/delete] command

when matched then

[insert/update/delete] command

46) Can 2 queries be executed simultaneously in a Distributed Database System?

Yes, they can be executed simultaneously. One query is always independent of the second query in a distributed database system based on the 2 phase commit.

47) Explain Raise_application_error.

It is a procedure of the package DBMS_STANDARD that allow issuing a user_defined error messages from the database trigger or stored sub-program.

48) What is out parameter used for eventhough return statement can also be used in pl/sql?

Out parameters allows more than one value in the calling program. Out parameter is not recommended in functions. Procedures can be used 
instead of functions if multiple values are required. Thus, these procedures are used to execute Out parameters.

49) How would you convert date into Julian date format?

We can use the J format string :

SQL > select to_char(to_date('29-Mar-2013','dd-mon-yyyy'),'J') as julian from dual;

JULIAN

50) Explain SPOOL

Spool command can print the output of sql statements in a file.

spool/tmp/sql_outtxt

select smp_name, smp_id from smp where dept='accounts';

spool off;

51) Mention what PL/SQL package consists of?

A PL/SQL package consists of

PL/SQL table and record TYPE statements
Procedures and Functions
Cursors
Variables ( tables, scalars, records, etc.) and constants
Exception names and pragmas for relating an error number with an exception
Cursors
52) Mention what are the benefits of PL/SQL packages?

It provides several benefits like

Enforced Information Hiding: It offers the liberty to choose whether to keep data private or public
Top-down design: You can design the interface to the code hidden in the package before you actually implemented the modules themselves
Object persistence: Objects declared in a package specification behaves like a global data for all PL/SQL objects in the application. 
You can modify the package in one module and then reference those changes to another module
Object oriented design: The package gives developers strong hold over how the modules and data structures inside the package can be used
Guaranteeing transaction integrity: It provides a level of transaction integrity
Performance improvement: The RDBMS automatically tracks the validity of all program objects stored in the database and enhance the performance of packages.
53) Mention what are different methods to trace the PL/SQL code?

Tracing code is a crucial technique to measure the code performance during the runtime. Different methods for tracing includes

DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO
DBMS_TRACE
DBMS_SESSION and DBMS_MONITOR
trcsess and tkproof utilities
54) Mention what does the hierarchical profiler does?

The hierarchical profiler could profile the calls made in PL/SQL, apart from filling the gap between the loopholes and the expectations
 of performance tracing. The efficiencies of the hierarchical profiler includes

Distinct reporting for SQL and PL/SQL time consumption
Reports count of distinct sub-programs calls made in the PL/SQL, and the time spent with each subprogram call
Multiple interactive analytics reports in HTML format by using the command line utility
More effective than conventional profiler and other tracing utilities
55) Mention what does PLV msg allows you to do?

The PLV msg enables you to

Assign individual text message to specified row in the PL/SQL table
It retrieves the message text by number
It substitutes automatically your own messages for standard Oracle error messages with restrict toggle
Batch load message numbers and text from a database table directly PLV msg PL/SQL table
56) Mention what is the PLV (PL/Vision) package offers?

Null substitution value
Set of assertion routines
Miscellaneous utilities
Set of constants used throughout PL vision
Pre-defined datatypes
57) Mention what is the use of PLVprs and PLVprsps?
PLVprs: It is an extension for string parsing for PL/SQL, and it is the lowest level of string parsing functionality
PLVprsps: It is the highest level package to parse PL/SQL source code into separate atomics. It relies on other parsing packages to get work done.
58) Explain how you can copy a file to file content and file to PL/SQL table in advance PL/SQL?

With a single program call - "fcopy procedure", you can copy the complete contents of one file into another file. While to copy the 
contents of a file directly into a PL/SQL table, you can use the program "file2pstab".

59) Explain how exception handling is done in advance PL/SQL?

For exception handling PL/SQl provides an effective plugin PLVexc. PLVexc supports four different exception handling actions.

Continue processing
Record and then continue
Halt processing
Record and then halt processing
For those exceptions that re-occurs you can use the RAISE statement.

60) Mention what problem one might face while writing log information to a data-base table in PL/SQL?

While writing log information to a database table, the problem you face is that the information is only available only once the new rows 
are committed to the database. This might be a problem as such PLVlog is usually deployed to track errors and in many such instances 
the current transaction would fail or otherwise needed a rollback.

61) Mention what is the function that is used to transfer a PL/SQL table log to a database table?

To transfer a PL/SQL table log a database log table function "PROCEDURE ps2db" is used.

62) When you have to use a default "rollback to" savepoint of PLVlog?

The default "rollback to" savepoint of PLVlog is used when the users has turned on the rollback activity and has not provided an alternative
 savepoint in the call to put_line. The default savepoint is initialized to the c none constant.

63) Why PLVtab is considered as the easiest way to access the PL/SQL table?

The PL/SQL table are the closest to arrays in PL/SQL, and in order to access this table you have to first declare a table type, and then
 you have to declare PL/SQL table itself. But by using PLVtab, you can avoid defining your own PL/SQL table type and make PL/SQL data-table access easy.

64) Mention what does PLVtab enables you to do when you showthe contents of PL/SQL tables?

PLVtab enables you to do following things when you show the contents of PL/SQL tables

Display or suppress a header for the table
Display or suppress the row numbers for the table values
Show a prefix before each row of the table
65) Explain how can you save or place your msg in a table?

To save msg in a table, you can do it in two ways

Load individual messages with calls to the add_text procedure
Load sets of messages from a database table with the load_from_dbms procedure
66) Mention what is the use of function "module procedure" in PL/SQL?

The "module procedure" enables to convert all the lines of code in a definite program unit with one procedure call. There are three arguments for modules

module_in
cor_in
Last_module_in
67) Mention what PLVcmt and PLVrb does in PL/SQL?

PL/Vision offers two packages that help you manage transaction processing in PL/SQL application. It is PLVcmt and PLVrb.

PLVcmt: PLVcmt package wraps logic and complexity for dealing with commit processing
PLVrb: It provides a programmatic interface to roll-back activity in PL/SQL






 

<b id="GN__linux_interview_questions:">GN__linux_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a>

1) What is Linux?

Linux is an operating system based on UNIX and was first introduced by Linus Torvalds. It is based on the Linux Kernel and can run on
 different hardware platforms manufactured by Intel, MIPS, HP, IBM, SPARC, and Motorola. Another popular element in Linux is its mascot,
 a penguin figure named Tux.

2) What is the difference between UNIX and LINUX?

Unix originally began as a propriety operating system from Bell Laboratories, which later on spawned into different commercial versions.
 On the other hand, Linux is free, open source and intended as a non-propriety operating system for the masses.

3) What is BASH?

BASH is short for Bourne Again SHell. It was written by Steve Bourne as a replacement to the original Bourne Shell (represented by /bin/sh).
 It combines all the features from the original version of Bourne Shell, plus additional functions to make it easier and more convenient to
 use. It has since been adapted as the default shell for most systems running Linux.

4) What is Linux Kernel?

The Linux Kernel is a low-level systems software whose main role is to manage hardware resources for the user. It is also used to provide
 an interface for user-level interaction.

5) What is LILO?

LILO is a boot loader for Linux. It is used mainly to load the Linux operating system into main memory so that it can begin its operations.

6) What is a swap space?

Swap space is a certain amount of space used by Linux to temporarily hold some programs that are running concurrently. This happens when RAM
 does not have enough memory to hold all programs that are executing.

7) What is the advantage of open source?

Open source allows you to distribute your software, including source codes freely to anyone who is interested. People would then be able to 
add features and even debug and correct errors that are in the source code. They can even make it run better and then redistribute these enhanced
 source code freely again. This eventually benefits everyone in the community.

8 ) What are the basic components of Linux?

Just like any other typical operating system, Linux has all of these components: kernel, shells and GUIs, system utilities, and an application
 program. What makes Linux advantageous over other operating system is that every aspect comes with additional features and all codes for these
 are downloadable for free.

9) Does it help for a Linux system to have multiple desktop environments installed?

In general, one desktop environment, like KDE or Gnome, is good enough to operate without issues. It's all a matter of preference for the user,
 although the system allows switching from one environment to another. Some programs will work in one environment and not work on the other, so
 it could also be considered a factor in selecting which environment to use.

10) What is the basic difference between BASH and DOS?

The key differences between the BASH and DOS console lie in 3 areas:

- BASH commands are case sensitive while DOS commands are not;

- Under BASH, / character is a directory separator and \ acts as an escape character. Under DOS, / serves as a command argument delimiter and \ 
is the directory separator

- DOS follows a convention in naming files, which is 8 character file name followed by a dot and 3 characters for the extension. BASH follows 
no such convention.

11) What is the importance of the GNU project?

This so-called Free software movement allows several advantages, such as the freedom to run programs for any purpose and freedom to study and 
modify a program to your needs. It also allows you to redistribute copies of software to other people, as well as the freedom to improve 
software and have it released for the public.

12) Describe the root account.

The root account is like a systems administrator account and allows you full control of the system. Here you can create and maintain user accounts,
 assigning different permissions for each account. It is the default account every time you install Linux.

13) What is CLI?

CLI is short for Command Line Interface. This interface allows the user to type declarative commands to instruct the computer to perform operations.
 CLI offers greater flexibility. However, other users who are already accustomed to using GUI find it difficult to remember commands including
 attributes that come with it.

14) What is GUI?

GUI, or Graphical User Interface, make use of images and icons that users click and manipulate as a way of communicating with the computer. 
Instead of having to remember and type commands, the use of graphical elements makes it easier to interact with the system, as well as adding
 more attraction through images, icons, and colors.

15) How do you open a command prompt when issuing a command?

To open the default shell (which is where the command prompt can be found), press Ctrl-Alt-F1. This will provide a command line interface (CLI)
 from which you can run commands as needed.

16) How can you find out how much memory Linux is using?

From a command shell, use the "concatenate" command: cat /proc/meminfo for memory usage information. You should see a line starting something 
like Mem: 64655360, etc. This is the total memory Linux thinks it has available to use.

You can also use commands

free - m

vmstat

top

htop
to find current memory usage

17) What is a typical size for a swap partition under a Linux system?

The preferred size for a swap partition is twice the amount of physical memory available on the system. If this is not possible, then the
 minimum size should be the same as the amount of memory installed.

 18) What are symbolic links?

Symbolic links act similarly to shortcuts in Windows. Such links point to programs, files or directories. It also allows you instant access
 to it without having to go directly to the entire pathname.

19) Does the Ctrl+Alt+Del key combination work on Linux?

Yes, it does. Just like Windows, you can use this key combination to perform a system restart. One difference is that you won't be getting
 any confirmation message and therefore, a reboot is immediate.

20) How do you refer to the parallel port where devices such as printers are connected?

Whereas under Windows you refer to the parallel port as the LPT port, under Linux you refer to it as /dev/lp . LPT1, LPT2 and LPT3 would 
therefore be referred to as /dev/lp0, /dev/lp1, or /dev/lp2 under Linux.

21) Are drives such as hard drive and floppy drives represented with drive letters?

No. In Linux, each drive and device have different designations. For example, floppy drives are referred to as /dev/fd0 and /dev/fd1. IDE/EIDE
 hard drives are referred to as /dev/hda, /dev/hdb, /dev/hdc, and so forth.

22) How do you change permissions under Linux?

Assuming you are the system administrator or the owner of a file or directory, you can grant permission using the chmod command. Use + symbol
 to add permission or - symbol to deny permission, along with any of the following letters: u (user), g (group), o (others), a (all), r (read),
 w (write) and x (execute). For example, the command chmod go+rw FILE1.TXT grants read and write access to the file FILE1.TXT, which is assigned to groups and others.

23) In Linux, what names are assigned to the different serial ports?

Serial ports are identified as /dev/ttyS0 to /dev/ttyS7. These are the equivalent names of COM1 to COM8 in Windows.

24) How do you access partitions under Linux?

Linux assigns numbers at the end of the drive identifier. For example, if the first IDE hard drive had three primary partitions, they would be
 named/numbered, /dev/hda1, /dev/hda2 and /dev/hda3.

25) What are hard links?

Hard links point directly to the physical file on disk, and not on the pathname. This means that if you rename or move the original file, the
 link will not break since the link is for the file itself, not the path where the file is located.

26) What is the maximum length for a filename under Linux?

Any filename can have a maximum of 255 characters. This limit does not include the path name, so therefore the entire pathname and filename could
 well exceed 255 characters.

27)What are filenames that are preceded by a dot?

In general, filenames that are preceded by a dot are hidden files. These files can be configuration files that hold important data or setup
 info. Setting these files as hidden makes it less likely to be accidentally deleted.

28) Explain virtual desktop.

This serves as an alternative to minimizing and maximizing different windows on the current desktop. Using virtual desktops can clear the
 desktop when you can open one or more programs. Rather than minimizing/restoring all those programs as needed, you can simply shuffle
 between virtual desktops with programs intact in each one.

29) How do you share a program across different virtual desktops under Linux?

To share a program across different virtual desktops, in the upper left-hand corner of a program window look for an icon that looks like a
 pushpin. Pressing this button will "pin" that application in place, making it appear in all virtual desktops, in the same position onscreen.

30) What does a nameless (empty) directory represent?

This empty directory name serves as the nameless base of the Linux file system. This serves as an attachment for all other directories,
 files, drives, and devices.

31) What is the pwd command?

The pwd command is short for print working directory command.

Example:

pwd
Output:

/home/guru99/myDir
32) What are daemons?

Daemons are services that provide several functions that may not be available under the base operating system. Its main task is to listen
 for service request and at the same time to act on these requests. After the service is done, it is then disconnected and waits for further requests.

33) How do you switch from one desktop environment to another, such as switching from KDE to Gnome?

Assuming you have these two environments installed, just log out from the graphical interface. Then at the login screen, type your login ID
 and password and choose which session type you wish to load. This choice will remain your default until you change it to something else.

34) What are the kinds of permissions under Linux?

There are 3 kinds of permissions under Linux:- Read: users may read the files or list the directory- Write: users may write to the file of new 
files to the directory- Execute: users may run the file or lookup a specific file within a directory

35) How does case sensitivity affect the way you use commands?

When we talk about case sensitivity, commands are considered identical only if every character is encoded as is, including lowercase and
 uppercase letters. This means that CD, cd, and Cd are three different commands. Entering a command using uppercase letters, where it
 should be in lowercase, will produce different outputs.

36) What are environmental variables?

Environmental variables are global settings that control the shell's function as well as that of other Linux programs. Another common term 
for environmental variables is global shell variables.

37) What are the different modes when using vi editor?

There are 3 modes under vi:- Command mode - this is the mode where you start in- Edit mode - this is the mode that allows you to do text
 editing- Ex mode - this is the mode wherein you interact with vi with instructions to process a file

38) Is it possible to use shortcuts for a long pathname?

Yes, there is. A feature known as filename expansion allows you do this using the TAB key. For example, if you have a path named /home/iceman/assignments
 directory, you would type as follows: /ho[tab]/ice[tab]/assi[tab] . This, however, assumes that the path is unique and that the shell you're using supports this feature.

39) What is redirection?

Redirection is the process of directing data from one output to another. It can also be used to direct an output as an input to another process.

40) What is grep command?

grep a search command that makes use of pattern-based searching. It makes use of options and parameters that are specified along with the command
 line and applies this pattern in searching the required file output.

41) What could be the problem when a command that was issued gave a different result from the last time it was used?

One highly possible reason for getting different results from what seems to be the same command has something to do with case sensitivity issues.
 Since Linux is case sensitive, a command that was previously used might have been entered in a different format from the present one. For example,
 to lists all files in the directory, you should type the command ls, and not LS. Typing LS will either result in an error message if there is no
 program by that exact name exist or may produce a different output if there is a program named LS that performs another function.

42) What are the contents of /usr/local?

It contains locally installed files. This directory matters in environments where files are stored on the network. Specifically, locally-installed
 files go to /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, etc.). Another application of this directory is that it is used for software packages installed from
 source, or software not officially shipped with the distribution.

43) How do you terminate an ongoing process?

Every process in the system is identified by a unique process id or pid. Use the kill command followed by the pid to terminate that process. To
 terminate all process at once, use kill 0.

44) How do you insert comments in the command line prompt?

Comments are created by typing the # symbol before the actual comment text. This tells the shell to completely ignore what follows. For 
example "# This is just a comment that the shell will ignore."

45) What is command grouping and how does it work?

You can use parentheses to group commands. For example, if you want to send the current date and time along with the contents of a file 
named OUTPUT to a second file named MYDATES, you can apply command grouping as follows: (date cat OUTPUT) > MYDATES

46) How do you execute more than one command or program from a single command line entry?

You can combine several commands by separating each command or program using a semicolon symbol. For example, you can issue such a 
series of commands in a single entry:

ls -l cd .. ls -a MYWORK which is equivalent to 3 commands: ls -l cd.. ls -a MYWORK
**Note that this will be executed one after the other, in the order specified.

47) Write a command that will look for files with an extension "c", and has the occurrence of the string "apple" in it.

Answer:

 Find ./ -name "*.c" | xargs grep -i "apple"
48) Write a command that will display all .txt files, including its individual permission.

Answer:

ls -al *.txt
49) Write a command that will do the following:

-look for all files in the current and subsequent directories with an extension c,v
-strip the,v from the result (you can use sed command)
-use the result and use a grep command to search for all occurrences of the word ORANGE in the files.

Find ./ -name "*.c,v" | sed 's/,v//g' | xargs grep "ORANGE"
50) What, if anything, is wrong with each of the following commands?

a) ls -l-s
b) cat file1, file2
c) ls - s Factdir

Answers:
a) there should be space between the 2 options: ls -l -s
b) do not use commas to separate arguments: cat file1 file2
c) there should be no space between hyphen and option label: ls -s Factdir

51) What is the command to calculate the size of a folder?

To calculate the size of a folder uses the command du -sh folder1.

52) How can you find the status of a process?

Use the command

ps ux

53) How can you check the memory status?

You can use the command

free -m to display output in MB

free -g to display output in GB

54) Explain how to color the Git console?

To color the Git console, you can use the command git config - global color.ui auto. In the command, the color.ui variable sets the
 default value for a variable such as color.diff and color.grep.

55) How can you append one file to another in Linux?

To append one file to another in Linux you can use command cat file2 >> file 1. The operator >> appends the output of the named 
file or creates the file if it is not created. While another command cat file 1 file 2 > file 3 appends two or more files to one.

56) Explain how you can find a file using Terminal?

To find a file you have to use a command, find . -name "process.txt" . It will look for the current directory for a file called process.txt.

57) Explain how you can create a folder using Terminal?

To create a folder, you have to use command mkdir. It will be something like these: ~$ mkdir Guru99

58) Explain how you can view the text file using Terminal?

To view the text file, go to the specific folder where the text files are located by using the command cd and then type less filename.txt.

59) Explain how to enable curl on Ubuntu LAMP stack?

To enable curl on Ubuntu, first, install libcurl, once done use following command sudo/etc/init .d /apache2 restart or sudo service apache2 restart.

60) Explain how to enable root logging in Ubuntu?

The command which enables root logging is

#sudo sh-c 'echo "greater-show-manual-login=true" >>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf'

61) How can you run a Linux program in the background simultaneously when you start your Linux Server?

By using nohup. It will stop the process receiving the NOHUP signal and thus terminating it you log out of the program which was
 invoked with. & runs the process in the background.

62) Explain how to uninstall the libraries in Linux?

To uninstall the libraries in Linux, you can use command sudo apt-get remove library_name

1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a client-side as well as server side scripting language that can be inserted into HTML pages and is understood by
 web browsers. JavaScript is also an Object based Programming language

2. Enumerate the differences between Java and JavaScript?

Java is a complete programming language. In contrast, JavaScript is a coded program that can be introduced to HTML pages. These two
 languages are not at all inter-dependent and are designed for the different intent. Java is an object - oriented programming (OOPS)
 or structured programming language like C++ or C whereas JavaScript is a client-side scripting language.

3. What are JavaScript Data Types?

Following are the JavaScript Data types:

Number
String
Boolean
Object
Undefined
4. What is the use of isNaN function?

isNan function returns true if the argument is not a number otherwise it is false.

5. Between JavaScript and an ASP script, which is faster?

JavaScript is faster. JavaScript is a client-side language and thus it does not need the assistance of the web server to execute. On
 the other hand, ASP is a server-side language and hence is always slower than JavaScript. Javascript now is also a server side language (nodejs).

6. What is negative infinity?

Negative Infinity is a number in JavaScript which can be derived by dividing negative number by zero.

7. Is it possible to break JavaScript Code into several lines?

Breaking within a string statement can be done by the use of a backslash, '\', at the end of the first line

Example:

document.write("This is \a program");
And if you change to a new line when not within a string statement, then javaScript ignores break in line.

Example:

var x=1, y=2,
z=
x+y;
The above code is perfectly fine, though not advisable as it hampers debugging.

8. Which company developed JavaScript?

Netscape is the software company who developed JavaScript.

9. What are undeclared and undefined variables?

Undeclared variables are those that do not exist in a program and are not declared. If the program tries to read 
the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered.

Undefined variables are those that are declared in the program but have not been given any value. If the program tries to
 read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.

10. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?

<html> 
<head> 
<title>t1</title> 
<script type="text/javascript"> 
	function addNode() { var newP = document.createElement("p"); 
	var textNode = document.createTextNode(" This is a new text node"); 
	newP.appendChild(textNode); document.getElementById("firstP").appendChild(newP); } 
</script> </head> 
<body> <p id="firstP">firstP<p> </body> 
</html>
11. What are global variables? How are these variable declared and what are the problems associated with using them?

Global variables are those that are available throughout the length of the code, that is, these have no scope. The var
 keyword is used to declare a local variable or object. If the var keyword is omitted, a global variable is declared.

Example:

// Declare a global globalVariable = "Test";

The problems that are faced by using global variables are the clash of variable names of local and global scope. Also,
 it is difficult to debug and test the code that relies on global variables.

12. What is a prompt box?

A prompt box is a box which allows the user to enter input by providing a text box. Label and box will be provided to enter the text or number.

13. What is 'this' keyword in JavaScript?

'This' keyword refers to the object from where it was called.

14. Explain the working of timers in JavaScript? Also elucidate the drawbacks of using the timer, if any?

Timers are used to execute a piece of code at a set time or also to repeat the code in a given interval of time.
 This is done by using the functions setTimeout, setInterval and clearInterval.

The setTimeout(function, delay) function is used to start a timer that calls a particular function after the mentioned delay.
 The setInterval(function, delay) function is used to repeatedly execute the given function in the mentioned delay and only 
 halts when cancelled. The clearInterval(id) function instructs the timer to stop.

Timers are operated within a single thread, and thus events might queue up, waiting to be executed.

15. Which symbol is used for comments in Javascript?

// for Single line comments and

/* Multi

Line

Comment

*/

16. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?

'ViewState' is specific to a page in a session.

'SessionState' is specific to user specific data that can be accessed across all pages in the web application.

17. What is === operator?

=== is called as strict equality operator which returns true when the two operands are having the same value without any type conversion.

18. Explain how can you submit a form using JavaScript?

To submit a form using JavaScript use document.form[0].submit();

document.form[0].submit();
19. Does JavaScript support automatic type conversion?

Yes JavaScript does support automatic type conversion, it is the common way of type conversion used by JavaScript developers

20. How can the style/class of an element be changed?

It can be done in the following way:

document.getElementById("myText").style.fontSize = "20?;
or

document.getElementById("myText").className = "anyclass";
21. Explain how to read and write a file using JavaScript?

There are two ways to read and write a file using JavaScript

Using JavaScript extensions
Using a web page and Active X objects
22. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?

Following are looping structures in Javascript:

For
While
do-while loops
23. What is called Variable typing in Javascript?

Variable typing is used to assign a number to a variable and the same variable can be assigned to a string.

Example

i = 10;
i = "string";
This is called variable typing.

24. How can you convert the string of any base to integer in JavaScript?

The parseInt() function is used to convert numbers between different bases. parseInt() takes the string to be converted 
as its first parameter, and the second parameter is the base of the given string.

In order to convert 4F (of base 16) to integer, the code used will be -

parseInt ("4F", 16);
25. Explain the difference between "==" and "==="?

"==" checks only for equality in value whereas "===" is a stricter equality test and returns false if either the value or
 the type of the two variables are different.

26. What would be the result of 3+2+"7"?

Since 3 and 2 are integers, they will be added numerically. And since 7 is a string, its concatenation will be done. So the result would be 57.

27. Explain how to detect the operating system on the client machine?

In order to detect the operating system on the client machine, the navigator.platform string (property) should be used.

28. What do mean by NULL in Javascript?

The NULL value is used to represent no value or no object. It implies no object or null string, no valid boolean value, no number and no array object.

29. What is the function of delete operator?

The delete keyword is used to delete the property as well as its value.

Example

var student= {age:20, batch:"ABC"};
delete student.age;
30. What is an undefined value in JavaScript?

Undefined value means the

Variable used in the code doesn't exist
Variable is not assigned to any value
Property doesn't exist
31. What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?

Alert
Confirm and
Prompt
32. What is the use of Void(0)?

Void(0) is used to prevent the page from refreshing and parameter "zero" is passed while calling.

Void(0) is used to call another method without refreshing the page.

33. How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?

The following code has to be inserted to achieve the desired effect:

<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript" >

<!-- location.href="http://newhost/newpath/newfile.html"; //--></script>
34. What is the data type of variables of in JavaScript?

All variables in the JavaScript are object data types.

35. What is the difference between an alert box and a confirmation box?

An alert box displays only one button which is the OK button.

But a Confirmation box displays two buttons namely OK and cancel.

36. What are escape characters?

Escape characters (Backslash) is used when working with special characters like single quotes, double quotes, apostrophes
 and ampersands. Place backslash before the characters to make it display.

Example:

document.write "I m a "good" boy"
document.write "I m a \"good\" boy"
37. What are JavaScript Cookies?

Cookies are the small test files stored in a computer and it gets created when the user visits the websites to store
 information that they need. Example could be User Name details and shopping cart information from the previous visits.

38. Explain what is pop()method in JavaScript?

The pop() method is similar as the shift() method but the difference is that the Shift method works at the start of the array.
 Also the pop() method take the last element off of the given array and returns it. The array on which is called is then altered.

Example:

var cloths = ["Shirt", "Pant", "TShirt"];
cloths.pop();
//Now cloth becomes Shirt,Pant

39. Whether JavaScript has concept level scope?

No. JavaScript does not have concept level scope. The variable declared inside the function has scope inside the function.

40. Mention what is the disadvantage of using innerHTML in JavaScript?

If you use innerHTML in JavaScript the disadvantage is

Content is replaced everywhere
We cannot use like "appending to innerHTML"
Even if you use +=like "innerHTML = innerHTML + 'html'" still the old content is replaced by html
The entire innerHTML content is re-parsed and build into elements, therefore its much slower
The innerHTML does not provide validation and therefore we can potentially insert valid and broken HTML in the document and break it
41. What is break and continue statements?

Break statement exits from the current loop.

Continue statement continues with next statement of the loop.

42. What are the two basic groups of dataypes in JavaScript?

They are as -

Primitive
Reference types.
Primitive types are number and Boolean data types. Reference types are more complex types like strings and dates.

43. How generic objects can be created?

Generic objects can be created as:

var I = new object();
44. What is the use of type of operator?

'Typeof' is an operator which is used to return a string description of the type of a variable.

45. Which keywords are used to handle exceptions?

Try... Catch---finally is used to handle exceptions in the JavaScript

Try{
	Code
}
Catch(exp){
	Code to throw an exception
}
Finally{
	Code runs either it finishes successfully or after catch
}
46. Which keyword is used to print the text in the screen?

document.write("Welcome") is used to print the text - Welcome in the screen.

47. What is the use of blur function?

Blur function is used to remove the focus from the specified object.

48. What is variable typing?

Variable typing is used to assign a number to a variable and then assign string to the same variable. Example is as follows:

i= 8;
i="john";
49. How to find operating system in the client machine using JavaScript?

The 'Navigator.appversion' is used to find the name of the operating system in the client machine.

50. What are the different types of errors in JavaScript?

There are three types of errors:

Load time errors: Errors which come up when loading a web page like improper syntax errors are known as Load time errors
 and it generates the errors dynamically.
Run time errors: Errors that come due to misuse of the command inside the HTML language.
Logical Errors: These are the errors that occur due to the bad logic performed on a function which is having different operation.
51. What is the use of Push method in JavaScript?

The push method is used to add or append one or more elements to the end of an Array. Using this method, we can append
 multiple elements by passing multiple arguments

52. What is unshift method in JavaScript?

Unshift method is like push method which works at the beginning of the array. This method is used to prepend one
 or more elements to the beginning of the array.

53. What is the difference between JavaScript and Jscript?

Both are almost similar. JavaScript is developed by Netscape and Jscript was developed by Microsoft .

54. How are object properties assigned?

Properties are assigned to objects in the following way -

obj["class"] = 12;
or

obj.class = 12;
55. What is the 'Strict' mode in JavaScript and how can it be enabled?

Strict Mode adds certain compulsions to JavaScript. Under the strict mode, JavaScript shows errors for a piece of
 codes, which did not show an error before, but might be problematic and potentially unsafe. Strict mode also
 solves some mistakes that hamper the JavaScript engines to work efficiently.

Strict mode can be enabled by adding the string literal "use strict" above the file. This can be illustrated by the given example:

function myfunction() {
    "use strict";
    var v = "This is a strict mode function";
}
56. What is the way to get the status of a CheckBox?

The status can be acquired as follows -

alert(document.getElementById('checkbox1').checked);

If the CheckBox will be checked, this alert will return TRUE.

57. How can the OS of the client machine be detected?

The navigator.appVersion string can be used to detect the operating system on the client machine.

58. Explain window.onload and onDocumentReady?

The onload function is not run until all the information on the page is loaded. This leads to a substantial delay before any code is executed.

onDocumentReady loads the code just after the DOM is loaded. This allows early manipulation of the code.

59. How will you explain closures in JavaScript? When are they used?

Closure is a locally declared variable related to a function which stays in memory when the function has returned.

For example:

function greet(message) {

    console.log(message);

}

function greeter(name, age) {

    return name + " says howdy!! He is " + age + " years old";

}

// Generate the message

var message = greeter("James", 23);

// Pass it explicitly to greet

greet(message);

This function can be better represented by using closures

function greeter(name, age) {

    var message = name + " says howdy!! He is " + age + " years old";

    return function greet() {

        console.log(message);

    };

}

// Generate the closure

var JamesGreeter = greeter("James", 23);

// Use the closure

JamesGreeter();
60. How can a value be appended to an array?

A value can be appended to an array in the given manner -

arr[arr.length] = value;

61. Explain the for-in loop?

The for-in loop is used to loop through the properties of an object.

The syntax for the for-in loop is -

for (variable name in object){
	statement or block to execute
}
In each repetition, one property from the object is associated to the variable name, and the loop is continued
 till all the properties of the object are depleted.

62. Describe the properties of an anonymous function in JavaScript?

A function that is declared without any named identifier is known as an anonymous function. In general,
 an anonymous function is inaccessible after its declaration.

Anonymous function declaration -

var anon = function() {
	alert('I am anonymous');
};
anon();
63. What is the difference between .call() and .apply()?

The function .call() and .apply() are very similar in their usage except a little difference. .call() is used when
 the number of the function's arguments are known to the programmer, as they have to be mentioned as arguments in 
 the call statement. On the other hand, .apply() is used when the number is not known. The function .apply() expects
 the argument to be an array.

The basic difference between .call() and .apply() is in the way arguments are passed to the function.
 Their usage can be illustrated by the given example.

var someObject = {
myProperty : 'Foo',

myMethod : function(prefix, postfix) {

	alert(prefix + this.myProperty + postfix);
}
};
someObject.myMethod('<', '>'); // alerts '<Foo>'
var someOtherObject  = {

	myProperty : 'Bar'

};
someObject.myMethod.call(someOtherObject, '<', '>'); // alerts '<Bar>'

someObject.myMethod.apply(someOtherObject, ['<', '>']); // alerts '<Bar>'
64. Define event bubbling?

JavaScript allows DOM elements to be nested inside each other. In such a case, if the handler of the child is clicked,
 the handler of parent will also work as if it were clicked too.

65. Is JavaScript case sensitive? Give an example?

Yes, JavaScript is case sensitive. For example, a function parseInt is not same as the function Parseint.

66. What boolean operators can be used in JavaScript?

The 'And' Operator (&&), 'Or' Operator (||) and the 'Not' Operator (!) can be used in JavaScript.

*Operators are without the parenthesis.

67. How can a particular frame be targeted, from a hyperlink, in JavaScript?

This can be done by including the name of the required frame in the hyperlink using the 'target' attribute.

<a href="/newpage.htm" target="newframe">>New Page</a>
68. What is the role of break and continue statements?

Break statement is used to come out of the current loop while the continue statement continues the current loop with a new recurrence.

69. Write the point of difference between web-garden and a web-farm?

Both web-garden and web-farm are web hosting systems. The only difference is that web-garden is a setup that includes
 many processors in a single server while web-farm is a larger setup that uses more than one server.

70. How are object properties assigned?

Assigning properties to objects is done in the same way as a value is assigned to a variable. For example,
 a form object's action value is assigned as 'submit' in the following manner - Document.form.action="submit"

71. What is the method for reading and writing a file in JavaScript?

This can be done by Using JavaScript extensions (runs from JavaScript Editor), example for opening of a file -

fh = fopen(getScriptPath(), 0);
72. How are DOM utilized in JavaScript?

DOM stands for Document Object Model and is responsible for how various objects in a document interact with each other.
 DOM is required for developing web pages, which includes objects like paragraph, links, etc. These objects can be operated 
 to include actions like add or delete. DOM is also required to add extra capabilities to a web page. On top of that,
 the use of API gives an advantage over other existing models.

73. How are event handlers utilized in JavaScript?

Events are the actions that result from activities, such as clicking a link or filling a form, by the user. An event handler is 
required to manage proper execution of all these events. Event handlers are an extra attribute of the object. 
This attribute includes event's name and the action taken if the event takes place.

74. Explain the role of deferred scripts in JavaScript?

By default, the parsing of the HTML code, during page loading, is paused until the script has not stopped executing. 
It means, if the server is slow or the script is particularly heavy, then the webpage is displayed with a delay. 
While using Deferred, scripts delays execution of the script till the time HTML parser is running. 
This reduces the loading time of web pages and they get displayed faster.

75. What are the various functional components in JavaScript?

The different functional components in JavaScript are-

First-class functions: Functions in JavaScript are utilized as first class objects. This usually means that these functions
 can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, assigned to variables or can
 also be stored in data structures.

Nested functions: The functions, which are defined inside other functions, are called Nested functions. 
They are called 'everytime' the main function is invoked.

76. Write about the errors shown in JavaScript?

JavaScript gives a message if it encounters an error. The recognized errors are -

Load-time errors: The errors shown at the time of the page loading are counted under Load-time errors. These errors are
 encountered by the use of improper syntax, and thus are detected while the page is getting loaded.
Run-time errors: This is the error that comes up while the program is running. It is caused by illegal operations,
 for example, division of a number by zero, or trying to access a non-existent area of the memory.
Logic errors: It is caused by the use of syntactically correct code, which does not fulfill the required task. For example, an infinite loop.
77. What are Screen objects?

Screen objects are used to read the information from the client's screen. The properties of screen objects are -

AvailHeight: Gives the height of client's screen
AvailWidth: Gives the width of client's screen.
ColorDepth: Gives the bit depth of images on the client's screen
Height: Gives the total height of the client's screen, including the taskbar
Width: Gives the total width of the client's screen, including the taskbar
78. Explain the unshift() method ?

This method is functional at the starting of the array, unlike the push(). It adds the desired number of elements 
to the top of an array. For example -

var name = [ "john" ];
name.unshift( "charlie" );
name.unshift( "joseph", "Jane" );
console.log(name);
The output is shown below:

[" joseph "," Jane ", " charlie ", " john "]
79. Define unescape() and escape() functions?

The escape () function is responsible for coding a string so as to make the transfer of the information from one computer to the other, across a network.

For Example:

<script>
	document.write(escape("Hello? How are you!"));
</script>
Output: Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21

The unescape() function is very important as it decodes the coded string.

It works in the following way. For example:

<script>
	document.write(unescape("Hello%3F%20How%20are%20you%21"));
</script>
Output: Hello? How are you!

80. What are the decodeURI() and encodeURI()?

EncodeURl() is used to convert URL into their hex coding. And DecodeURI() is used to convert the encoded URL back to normal.

<script>
	var uri="my test.asp?name=ståle&car=saab";

	document.write(encodeURI(uri)+ "<br>");

	document.write(decodeURI(uri));
</script>
Output -

my%20test.asp?name=st%C3%A5le&car=saab

my test.asp?name=ståle&car=saab

81. Why it is not advised to use innerHTML in JavaScript?

innerHTML content is refreshed every time and thus is slower. There is no scope for validation in innerHTML and, 
therefore, it is easier to insert rouge code in the document and, thus, make the web page unstable.

82. What does the following statement declares?

var myArray = [[[]]];
It declares a three dimensional array.

83. How are JavaScript and ECMA Script related?

ECMA Script are like rules and guideline while Javascript is a scripting language used for web development.

84. What is namespacing in JavaScript and how is it used?

Namespacing is used for grouping the desired functions, variables etc. under a unique name. It is a name that has 
been attached to the desired functions, objects and properties. This improves modularity in the coding and enables code reuse.




<b id="GN__c#_interview_questions:">GN__c#_interview_questions:</b>	<a href="#study">study</a> 

1. What is C#?

C# is an object-oriented, type-safe, and managed language that is compiled by .Net framework to generate Microsoft Intermediate Language.

2. Explain types of comment in C# with examples

Single line

Example:

//This is a single line comment
ii. Multiple line (/* */)

Example:

/*This is a multiple line comment
We are in line 2
Last line of comment*/
iii. XML Comments (///).

Eg:

/// summary;
/// Set error message for multilingual language.
/// summary
3. Can multiple catch blocks be executed?

No, Multiple catch blocks can't be executed. Once the proper catch code executed, the control is transferred to the finally block,
 and then the code that follows the finally block gets executed.

4. What is the difference between public, static, and void?

Public declared variables or methods are accessible anywhere in the application. Static declared variables or methods are globally 
accessible without creating an instance of the class. Static member are by default not globally accessible it depends upon the type of 
access modified used. The compiler stores the address of the method as the entry point and uses this information to begin execution before
 any objects are created. And Void is a type modifier that states that the method or variable does not return any value.

5. What is an object?

An object is an instance of a class through which we access the methods of that class. "New" keyword is used to create an object. 
A class that creates an object in memory will contain the information about the methods, variables, and behavior of that class.

6. Define Constructors

A constructor is a member function in a class that has the same name as its class. The constructor is automatically invoked 
whenever an object class is created. It constructs the values of data members while initializing the class.

7. What is Jagged Arrays?
The Array which has elements of type array is called jagged Array. The elements can be of different dimensions and sizes. 
We can also call jagged Array as an Array of arrays.

8. What is the difference between ref & out parameters?

An argument passed as ref must be initialized before passing to the method whereas out parameter needs not to be initialized before passing to a method.

9. What is the use of 'using' statement in C#?

The 'using' block is used to obtain a resource and process it and then automatically dispose of when the execution of the block completed.

10. What is serialization?

When we want to transport an object through a network, then we have to convert the object into a stream of bytes. 
The process of converting an object into a stream of bytes is called Serialization. For an object to be serializable, 
it should implement ISerialize Interface. De-serialization is the reverse process of creating an object from a stream of bytes.

11. Can we use "this" command within a static method?

We can't use 'This' in a static method because we can only use static variables/methods in a static method.

12. What is the difference between constants and read-only?

Constant variables are declared and initialized at compile time. The value can't be changed afterward. Read-only is used only when we want to assign the value at run time.

13. What is an interface class? Give one example of it

An Interface is an abstract class which has only public abstract methods, and the methods only have the declaration 
and not the definition. These abstract methods must be implemented in the inherited classes.

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
namespace DemoApplication
{
 interface Guru99Interface
 {
  void SetTutorial(int pID, string pName);
  String GetTutorial();
 }

 class Guru99Tutorial : Guru99Interface
 {
  protected int TutorialID;
  protected string TutorialName;

  public void SetTutorial(int pID, string pName)
  {
   TutorialID = pID;
   TutorialName = pName;
  }

  public String GetTutorial()
  {
   return TutorialName;
  }

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
   Guru99Tutorial pTutor = new Guru99Tutorial();

   pTutor.SetTutorial(1,".Net by Guru99");

   Console.WriteLine(pTutor.GetTutorial());

   Console.ReadKey();
  }
 }
}
14. What are value types and reference types?

A value type holds a data value within its own memory space. Example

int a = 30;
Reference type stores the address of the Object where the value is being stored. It is a pointer to another memory location.

string b = "Hello Guru99!!";
15. What are Custom Control and User Control?

Custom Controls are controls generated as compiled code (Dlls), those are easier to use and can be added to toolbox. 
Developers can drag and drop controls to their web forms. Attributes can, at design time. We can easily add custom controls
 to Multiple Applications (If Shared Dlls). So, If they are private, then we can copy to dll to bin directory of web 
 application and then add reference and can use them.

User Controls are very much similar to ASP include files, and are easy to create. User controls can't be placed in the 
toolbox and dragged - dropped from it. They have their design and code-behind. The file extension for user controls is ascx.

16. What are sealed classes in C#?

We create sealed classes when we want to restrict the class to be inherited. Sealed modifier used to prevent derivation 
from a class. If we forcefully specify a sealed class as base class, then a compile-time error occurs.

17. What is method overloading?

Method overloading is creating multiple methods with the same name with unique signatures in the same class. When we compile, 
the compiler uses overload resolution to determine the specific method to be invoke.

18. What is the difference between Array and Arraylist?

In an array, we can have items of the same type only. The size of the array is fixed when compared. To an arraylist is similar 
to an array, but it doesn't have a fixed size.

19. Can a private virtual method can be overridden?

No, because they are not accessible outside the class.

20. Describe the accessibility modifier "protected internal".

Protected Internal variables/methods are accessible within the same assembly and also from the classes that are derived from this parent class.

21. What are the differences between System.String and System.Text.StringBuilder classes?

System.String is immutable. When we modify the value of a string variable, then a new memory is allocated to the new value and 
the previous memory allocation released. System.StringBuilder was designed to have a concept of a mutable string where a variety of 
operations can be performed without allocation separate memory location for the modified string.

22. What's the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone() ?

Using Clone() method, we creates a new array object containing all the elements in the original Array and using CopyTo() method. All 
the elements of existing array copies into another existing array. Both methods perform a shallow copy.

23. How can we sort the elements of the Array in descending order?

Using Sort() methods followed by Reverse() method.

24. Write down the C# syntax to catch an exception

To catch an exception, we use try-catch blocks. Catch block can have a parameter of system.Exception type.

Eg:
try {
    GetAllData();
} 
catch (Exception ex) {
}
In the above example, we can omit the parameter from catch statement.

25. What's the difference between an interface and abstract class?

Interfaces have all the methods having only declaration but no definition. In an abstract class, we can have some concrete methods.
 In an interface class, all the methods are public. An abstract class may have private methods.

26. What is the difference between Finalize() and Dispose() methods?

Dispose() is called when we want for an object to release any unmanaged resources with them. On the other hand, Finalize() is used 
for the same purpose, but it doesn't assure the garbage collection of an object.

27. What are circular references?

Circular reference is situation in which two or more resources are interdependent on each other causes the lock condition and make 
the resources unusable.

28. What are generics in C#.NET?

Generics are used to make reusable code classes to decrease the code redundancy, increase type safety, and performance. Using generics, 
we can create collection classes. To create generic collection, System.Collections.Generic namespace should be used instead of classes 
such as ArrayList in the System.Collections namespace. Generics promotes the usage of parameterized types.

29. What is an object pool in .NET?

An object pool is a container having objects ready to be used. It tracks the object that is currently in use, total number of objects 
in the pool. This reduces the overhead of creating and re-creating objects.

30. List down the commonly used types of exceptions in .net

ArgumentException, ArgumentNullException , ArgumentOutOfRangeException, ArithmeticException, DivideByZeroException ,OverflowException , 
IndexOutOfRangeException ,InvalidCastException ,InvalidOperationException , IOEndOfStreamException , NullReferenceException , 
OutOfMemoryException , StackOverflowException etc.

31. What are Custom Exceptions?

Sometimes there are some errors that need to be handled as per user requirements. Custom exceptions are used for them and are used defined exceptions.

32. What are delegates?

Delegates are same are function pointers in C++, but the only difference is that they are type safe, unlike function pointers. 
Delegates are required because they can be used to write much more generic type-safe functions.

33. How do you inherit a class into other class in C#?

Colon is used as inheritance operator in C#. Just place a colon and then the class name.

public class DerivedClass : BaseClass

34. What is the base class in .net from which all the classes are derived from?

System.Object
35. What is the difference between method overriding and method overloading?

In method overriding, we change the method definition in the derived class that changes the method behavior. Method overloading is 
creating a method with the same name within the same class having different signatures.

36. What are the different ways a method can be overloaded?

Methods can be overloaded using different data types for a parameter, different order of parameters, and different number of parameters.

37. Why can't you specify the accessibility modifier for methods inside the interface?

In an interface, we have virtual methods that do not have method definition. All the methods are there to be overridden in the derived class. 
That's why they all are public.

38. How can we set the class to be inherited, but prevent the method from being over-ridden?

Declare the class as public and make the method sealed to prevent it from being overridden.

39. What happens if the inherited interfaces have conflicting method names?

Implement is up to you as the method is inside your own class. There might be a problem when the methods from different interfaces 
expect different data, but as far as compiler cares you're okay.

40. What is the difference between a Struct and a Class?

Structs are value-type variables, and classes are reference types. Structs stored on the Stack causes additional overhead but 
faster retrieval. Structs cannot be inherited.

41. How to use nullable types in .Net?

Value types can take either their normal values or a null value. Such types are called nullable types.

Int? someID = null;
If(someID.HasVAlue)
{
}
42. How we can create an array with non-default values?

We can create an array with non-default values using Enumerable.Repeat.

43. What is difference between "is" and "as" operators in c#?

"is" operator is used to check the compatibility of an object with a given type, and it returns the result as Boolean.

"as" operator is used for casting of an object to a type or a class.

44. What's a multicast delegate?

A delegate having multiple handlers assigned to it is called multicast delegate. Each handler is assigned to a method.

45. What are indexers in C# .NET?

Indexers are known as smart arrays in C#. It allows the instances of a class to be indexed in the same way as an array.

Eg:

public int this[int index]    // Indexer declaration
46. What is difference between the "throw" and "throw ex" in .NET?

"Throw" statement preserves original error stack whereas "throw ex" have the stack trace from their throw point. It is always 
advised to use "throw" because it provides more accurate error information.

47. What are C# attributes and its significance?

C# provides developers a way to define declarative tags on certain entities, eg. Class, method, etc. are called attributes. 
The attribute's information can be retrieved at runtime using Reflection.

48. How to implement a singleton design pattern in C#?

In a singleton pattern, a class can only have one instance and provides an access point to it globally.

Eg:

Public sealed class Singleton
{
Private static readonly Singleton _instance = new Singleton();
}
49. What is the difference between directcast and ctype?

DirectCast is used to convert the type of object that requires the run-time type to be the same as the specified type in DirectCast.

Ctype is used for conversion where the conversion is defined between the expression and the type.

50. Is C# code is managed or unmanaged code?

C# is managed code because Common language runtime can compile C# code to Intermediate language.

51. What is Console application?

A console application is an application that can be run in the command prompt in Windows. For any beginner on .Net, 
building a console application is ideally the first step, to begin with.

52. Give an example of removing an element from the queue

The dequeue method is used to remove an element from the queue.

using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace DemoApplication
{
 class Program
 {
  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
   Queue qt = new Queue();
   qt.Enqueue(1);
   qt.Enqueue(2);
   qt.Enqueue(3);

   foreach (Object obj in qt)
   {
    Console.WriteLine(obj);
   }
    Console.WriteLine(); Console.WriteLine();
    Console.WriteLine("The number of elements in the Queue " + qt.Count);
    Console.WriteLine("Does the Queue contain " + qt.Contains(3));
    Console.ReadKey();
   }
 }
}

1. What is ASP.Net?

It is a framework developed by Microsoft on which we can develop new generation web sites using web forms(aspx), MVC, HTML, 
Javascript, CSS etc. Its successor of Microsoft Active Server Pages(ASP). Currently there is ASP.NET 4.0, which is used to 
develop web sites. There are various page extensions provided by Microsoft that are being used for web site development. 
Eg: aspx, asmx, ascx, ashx, cs, vb, html, XML etc.

2. What's the use of Response.Output.Write()?

We can write formatted output using Response.Output.Write().

3. In which event of page cycle is the ViewState available?

After the Init() and before the Page_Load().

4. What is the difference between Server.Transfer and Response.Redirect?

In Server.Transfer page processing transfers from one page to the other page without making a round-trip back to the client's browser. 
This provides a faster response with a little less overhead on the server. The clients url history list or current url Server does 
not update in case of Server.Transfer.

Response.Redirect is used to redirect the user's browser to another page or site. It performs trip back to the client where the
 client's browser is redirected to the new page. The user's browser history list is updated to reflect the new address.

5. From which base class all Web Forms are inherited?

Page class.

6. What are the different validators in ASP.NET?

Required field Validator
Range Validator
Compare Validator
Custom Validator
Regular expression Validator
Summary Validator
7. Which validator control you use if you need to make sure the values in two different controls matched?

Compare Validator control.

8. What is ViewState?

ViewState is used to retain the state of server-side objects between page post backs.

9. Where the viewstate is stored after the page postback?

ViewState is stored in a hidden field on the page at client side. ViewState is transported to the client and back to the server, 
and is not stored on the server or any other external source.

10. How long the items in ViewState exists?

They exist for the life of the current page.

11. What are the different Session state management options available in ASP.NET?

In-Process
Out-of-Process.
In-Process stores the session in memory on the web server.

Out-of-Process Session state management stores data in an external server. The external server may be either a SQL Server or a
 State Server. All objects stored in session are required to be serializable for Out-of-Process state management.

12. How you can add an event handler?

Using the Attributes property of server side control.

e.g.

btnSubmit.Attributes.Add("onMouseOver","JavascriptCode();")
13. What is caching?

Caching is a technique used to increase performance by keeping frequently accessed data or files in memory. The request for a 
cached file/data will be accessed from cache instead of actual location of that file.

14. What are the different types of caching?

ASP.NET has 3 kinds of caching :

Output Caching,
Fragment Caching,
Data Caching.
15. Which type if caching will be used if we want to cache the portion of a page instead of whole page?

Fragment Caching: It caches the portion of the page generated by the request. For that, we can create user controls with the below code:

<%@ OutputCache Duration="120" VaryByParam="CategoryID;SelectedID"%>
16. List the events in page life cycle.

1) Page_PreInit
2) Page_Init
3) Page_InitComplete
4) Page_PreLoad
5) Page_Load
6) Page_LoadComplete
7) Page_PreRender
8) Render

17. Can we have a web application running without web.Config file?

Yes

18. Is it possible to create web application with both webforms and mvc?

Yes. We have to include below mvc assembly references in the web forms application to create hybrid application.

System.Web.Mvc

System.Web.Razor

System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations
19. Can we add code files of different languages in App_Code folder?
No. The code files must be in same language to be kept in App_code folder.

20. What is Protected Configuration?

It is a feature used to secure connection string information.

21. Write code to send e-mail from an ASP.NET application?

MailMessage mailMess = new MailMessage ();
mailMess.From = "abc@gmail.com
	";
mailMess.To = "xyz@gmail.com";
mailMess.Subject = "Test email";
mailMess.Body = "Hi This is a test mail.";
SmtpMail.SmtpServer = "localhost";
SmtpMail.Send (mailMess);
MailMessage and SmtpMail are classes defined System.Web.Mail namespace.

22. How can we prevent browser from caching an ASPX page?

We can SetNoStore on HttpCachePolicy object exposed by the Response object's Cache property:

Response.Cache.SetNoStore ();
Response.Write (DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString ());
23. What is the good practice to implement validations in aspx page?

Client-side validation is the best way to validate data of a web page. It reduces the network traffic and saves server resources.

24. What are the event handlers that we can have in Global.asax file?

Application Events: Application_Start , Application_End, Application_AcquireRequestState, Application_AuthenticateRequest, 
Application_AuthorizeRequest, Application_BeginRequest, Application_Disposed, Application_EndRequest, Application_Error, 
Application_PostRequestHandlerExecute, Application_PreRequestHandlerExecute,Application_PreSendRequestContent, 
Application_PreSendRequestHeaders, Application_ReleaseRequestState, Application_ResolveRequestCache, Application_UpdateRequestCache

Session Events: Session_Start,Session_End

25. Which protocol is used to call a Web service?

HTTP Protocol

26. Can we have multiple web config files for an asp.net application?

Yes.

27. What is the difference between web config and machine config?

Web config file is specific to a web application where as machine config is specific to a machine or server. There can be multiple
 web config files into an application where as we can have only one machine config file on a server.

28. Explain role based security ?

Role Based Security used to implement security based on roles assigned to user groups in the organization.

Then we can allow or deny users based on their role in the organization. Windows defines several built-in groups, including
 Administrators, Users, and Guests.

<AUTHORIZATION>< authorization >
< allow roles="Domain_Name\Administrators" / >   < !-- Allow Administrators in domain. -- >
< deny users="*"  / >                            < !-- Deny anyone else. -- >
< /authorization >
29. What is Cross Page Posting?

When we click submit button on a web page, the page post the data to the same page. The technique in which we post the data to 
different pages is called Cross Page posting. This can be achieved by setting POSTBACKURL property of the button that causes the 
postback. Findcontrol method of PreviousPage can be used to get the posted values on the page to which the page has been posted.

30. How can we apply Themes to an asp.net application?

We can specify the theme in web.config file. Below is the code example to apply theme:

<configuration>

<system.web>

<pages theme="Windows7" />

</system.web>

</configuration>
31. What is RedirectPermanent in ASP.Net?

RedirectPermanent Performs a permanent redirection from the requested URL to the specified URL. Once the redirection is done, 
it also returns 301 Moved Permanently responses.

32. What is MVC?

MVC is a framework used to create web applications. The web application base builds on Model-View-Controller pattern which 
separates the application logic from UI, and the input and events from the user will be controlled by the Controller.

33. Explain the working of passport authentication.

First of all it checks passport authentication cookie. If the cookie is not available then the application redirects the user
 to Passport Sign on page. Passport service authenticates the user details on sign on page and if valid then stores the
 authenticated cookie on client machine and then redirect the user to requested page

34. What are the advantages of Passport authentication?

All the websites can be accessed using single login credentials. So no need to remember login credentials for each web site.

Users can maintain his/ her information in a single location.

35. What are the asp.net Security Controls?

<asp:Login>: Provides a standard login capability that allows the users to enter their credentials
<asp:LoginName>: Allows you to display the name of the logged-in user
<asp:LoginStatus>: Displays whether the user is authenticated or not
<asp:LoginView>: Provides various login views depending on the selected template
<asp:PasswordRecovery>: email the users their lost password
36. How do you register JavaScript for webcontrols ?We can register javascript for controls using <CONTROL -name>Attribtues.Add(scriptname,scripttext) method.

37. In which event are the controls fully loaded?

Page load event.

38. what is boxing and unboxing?

Boxing is assigning a value type to reference type variable.

Unboxing is reverse of boxing ie. Assigning reference type variable to value type variable.

39. Differentiate strong typing and weak typing

In strong typing, the data types of variable are checked at compile time. On the other hand, in case of weak typing the 
variable data types are checked at runtime. In case of strong typing, there is no chance of compilation error. 
Scripts use weak typing and hence issues arises at runtime.

40. How we can force all the validation controls to run?

The Page.Validate() method is used to force all the validation controls to run and to perform validation.

41. List all templates of the Repeater control.

ItemTemplate
AlternatingltemTemplate
SeparatorTemplate
HeaderTemplate
FooterTemplate
42. List the major built-in objects in ASP.NET?

Application
Request
Response
Server
Session
Context
Trace
43. What is the appSettings Section in the web.config file?

The appSettings block in web config file sets the user-defined values for the whole application.

For example, in the following code snippet, the specified ConnectionString section is used throughout the project for database connection:

<em><configuration>
<appSettings>
<add key="ConnectionString" value="server=local; pwd=password; database=default" />
</appSettings></em>
44. Which data type does the RangeValidator control support?

The data types supported by the RangeValidator control are Integer, Double, String, Currency, and Date.

45. What is the difference between an HtmlInputCheckBox control and an HtmlInputRadioButton control?

In HtmlInputCheckBoxcontrol, multiple item selection is possible whereas in HtmlInputRadioButton controls,
 we can select only single item from the group of items.

46. Which namespaces are necessary to create a localized application?

System.Globalization

System.Resources

47. What are the different types of cookies in ASP.NET?

Session Cookie - Resides on the client machine for a single session until the user does not log out.

Persistent Cookie - Resides on a user's machine for a period specified for its expiry, such as 10 days, one month, and never.

48. What is the file extension of web service?

Web services have file extension .asmx..

49. What are the components of ADO.NET?

The components of ADO.Net are Dataset, Data Reader, Data Adaptor, Command, connection.

50. What is the difference between ExecuteScalar and ExecuteNonQuery?

ExecuteScalar returns output value where as ExecuteNonQuery does not return any value but the number of rows 
affected by the query. ExecuteScalar used for fetching a single value and ExecuteNonQuery used to execute Insert and Update statements.
