In this post, we see API Testing Interview Questions. Before going ahead, let's see some unavoidable Interview Questions which every hiring manager 
asks you in any Software Testing interview.

Let's move with the actual post on API Interview Questions And Answers.

1. What is an API?

API is an acronym and it stands for Application Programming Interface. API is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building Software Applications.
 APIs specify how one software program should interact with other software program.

In simple words, API stands for Application Programming Interface. API acts as an interface between two software applications and allows the two software
 applications to communicate with each other. API is a collection of software functions which can be executed by another software program.

2. What is API Testing?

API testing is a type of software testing that involves testing APIs directly and also as a part of integration testing to check whether the API meets 
expectations in terms of functionality, reliability, performance, and security of an application. In API Testing our main focus will be on Business logic 
layer of the software architecture. API testing can be performed on any software system which contains multiple APIs.

3. What are the common API Testing Types?

API testing typically involves the following practices:

Unit testing
Functional testing
Load testing
Runtime/ Error Detection
Security testing
UI testing
Interoperability and WS Compliance testing
Penetration testing
Fuzz testing
Learn more on API Testing Types

4. Name some of the common protocols used in API Testing?

Some of the protocols using in API Testing are as follows:

HTTP
REST
SOAP
JMS
UDDI

5. Difference between API and Web services?

Web services:

1. All web services are APIs
2. All web services need to be exposed over web(HTTP)
3. A Web service uses only three styles of use: SOAP, REST and XML-RPC for communication
4. A Web service always needs a network to operate

APIs:

1. All APIs are not web services
2. All APIs need not be exposed over web(i.e. HTTP)
3. API uses multiple ways for communication e.g. DLL files in C/C++, Jar files/ RMI in java, Interrupts in Linux kernel API etc.
4. APIs don't need a network for operation

6. What is Soap?

SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. It is an XML based messaging protocol. It helps in exchanging information among computers.

7. What is Rest API?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a set of functions helping developers in performing requests and receive responses. 
Interaction is made through HTTP Protocol in REST API.

8. Difference between SOAP and REST?

SOAP:
1. SOAP is a protocol through which two computers communicate by sharing XML document
2. SOAP supports only XML format
3. SOAP does not support caching
4. SOAP is slower than REST
5. SOAP is like custom desktop application, closely conneccted to the server
6. SOAP runs on HTTP but envelopes the message

REST:
1. REST is a service architecture and design for network-based software architecture
2. REST supports different data formats
3. REST supports caching
4. REST is faster than SOAP
5. REST client is just like a browser and uses standard methods An application has to fit inside it
6. REST uses the HTTP headers to hold meta information

9. What are the common tests that are performed on APIs?

Some of the common tests we perform on APIs are as follows.

1. Verify whether the return value is based on input condition. Response of the APIs should be verified based on the request.
2. Verify whether the system is authenticating the outcome when the API is updating any data structure
3. Verify whether the API triggers some other event or request another API
4. Verify the behaviour of the API when there is no return value

10. What are the advantages of API Testing?

API Testing is time effective when compared to GUI Testing. API test automation requires less code so it can provide faster and better test coverage.
API Testing helps us to reduce the testing cost. With API Testing we can find minor bugs before the GUI Testing. These minor bugs will become bigger
 during the GUI Testing. So finding those bugs in the API Testing will be cost effective to the Company.
API Testing is language independent.
API Testing is quite helpful in testing Core Functionality. We can test the APIs without a user interface. In GUI Testing, we need to wait until the
 application is available to test the core functionalities.
API Testing helps us to reduce the risks.

11. What exactly needs to be verified in API Testing?

Basically, on API Testing, we send a request to the API with the known data and we analyse the response.
1. Data accuracy
2. HTTP status codes
3. Response time
3. Error codes in case API returns any errors
4. Authorization checks
5. Non functional testing such as performance testing, security testing

12. Name some tools used for API Testing?

Some of the tools used for API Testing are as follows:

Postman
Katalon Studio
SoapUI
Assertible
Tricentis Tosca
Apigee
JMeter
Rest-Assured
Karate DSL
API Fortress
Parasoft
HP QTP(UFT)
vREST
Airborne
API Science
APIary Inspector
Citrus Framework
Hippie-Swagger
HttpMaster Express
Mockbin
Ping API
Pyresttest
Rest Console
RoboHydra Server
SOAP Sonar
Unirest
WebInject


13. List some most used templates for API documentation?

Some of the API documentation templates are as follows.

Swagger
FlatDoc
RestDoc
API blueprint
Slate
Miredot
Web service API Specification.

14. Name some of the API examples which are quite popular.

Some of the popular API examples are

Google Maps API
YouTube
Twitter
Amazon Advertising API

15. Difference between API testing and Unit Testing?

UNIT TESTING:

Unit testing is conducted by Development Team
Unit testing is a form of White box testing
Unit testing is conducted prior to the process of including the code in the build
Source code is involved in Unit testing
In unit testing, the scope of testing is limited, so only basic functionalities are considered for testing
API TESTING:

API testing is conducted by QA Team
API testing is a form of Black box testing
API testing is conducted after the build is ready for testing
Source code is not involved in API testing
In API testing, the scope of testing is wide, so all the issues that are functional are considered for testing

16. What are the main challenges faced in API testing?

Some of the challenges we face while doing API testing are as follows

Selecting proper parameters and its combinations
Categorizing the parameters properly
Proper call sequencing is required as this may lead to inadequate coverage in testing
Verifying and validating the output
Due to absence of GUI it is quite difficult to provide input values

17. What are the types of bugs we face when performing API testing?

Issues observed when performing API testing are

Stress, performance, and security issues
Duplicate or missing functionality
Reliability issues
Improper messaging
Incompatible error handling mechanism
Multi-threaded issues
Improper errors

18. How is UI testing is not similar to API testing?

UI (User Interface) testing is to test the graphical interface part of the application. Its main focus is to test the look and feel of an application.
 On the other hand, API testing enables communication between two different software systems. Its main focus is in business layer of the application.

19. Name some most commonly used HTTP methods?

Some of the HTTP methods are

GET: It enables you to retrieve data from a server
POST: It enables you to add data to an existing file or resource in a server
PUT: It lets you replace an existing file or resource in a server
DELETE: It lets you delete data from a server
PATCH: It is used to apply partial modifications to a resource
OPTIONS: It is used to describe the communication options for the target resource
HEAD: It asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body

20. Can you use GET request instead of PUT to create a resource?

No, GET request only allows read only rights. It enables you to retrieve data from a server but not create a resource. PUT or POST methods should
 be used to create a resource.

21. What is the difference between PUT and POST methods?

PUT and POST methods are sometimes confused in regards to when each should be used. Using POST request, our intent is to create a new object on 
the server whereas with PUT request, our intent is to replace an object by another object.

POST should be used when the client sends the page to the server and then the server lets the client know where it put it. PUT should be used when 
the client specifies the location of the page

Learn API Testing in detail
I would like to conclude this post "API Testing Interview Questions" here. Final words, Bookmark this post "API Interview Questions And Answers" 
for future reference.
Here I have hand-picked few posts which will help you to learn more interview related stuff:

*********************************************************************************************************************

Definition & Functions of an API (Common Web API Testing interview questions)
1. What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a software intermediary that enables two applications to communicate with each other. It comprises a number of subroutine definitions, logs, and tools for creating application software.

In an API testing interview, you could be asked to give some API examples, here are the well-known ones: Google Maps API, Amazon Advertising API, Twitter API, YouTube API, etc.

2. What are main differences between API and Web Service?
All Web services are APIs but not all APIs are Web services.
Web services might not contain all the specifications and cannot perform all the tasks that APIs would perform.
A Web service uses only three styles of use: SOAP, REST and XML-RPC for communication whereas API may be exposed to in multiple ways.
A Web service always needs a network to operate while APIs don’t need a network for operation.
3. What are the Limits of API Usage?
Many APIs have a certain limit set up by the provider. Thus, try to estimate your usage and understand how that will impact the overall cost of the offering. Whether this will be a problem depends in large part on how data is leveraged. Getting caught by a quota and effectively cut-off because of budget limitations will render the service (and any system or process depending on it) virtually useless.

Creating an API (Common Web API Testing interview questions)
4. What are some architectural styles for creating a Web API?
This is one of the fundamental Web API interview questions. Bellows are four common Web API architectural styles:

HTTP for client-server communication
XML/JSON as formatting language
Simple URI as the address for the services
Stateless communication
5. Who can use a Web API?
Web API can be consumed by any clients which support HTTP verbs such as GET, PUT, DELETE, POST. Since Web API services do not require configuration, they can be easily used by any client. In fact, even portable devices such as mobile devices can easily use Web API, which is undoubtedly the biggest advantage of this technology.

 

Testing an API – Top Web API Testing interview questions & answers
6. What is API Testing?
API testing is a kind of software testing which determines if the developed APIs meet expectations regarding the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of the application.

7. What are the advantages of API Testing?  
In an API interview, they are likely to ask about the advantages of API testing. So be prepared with the significant ones such as:

Test for Core Functionality: API testing provides access to the application without a user interface. The core and code-level of functionalities of the application will be tested and evaluated early before the GUI tests. This will help detect the minor issues which can become bigger during the GUI testing.
Time Effective: API testing usually is less time consuming than functional GUI testing. The web elements in GUI testing must be polled, which makes the testing process slower. Particularly, API test automation requires less code so it can provide better and faster test coverage compared to GUI test automation. These will result in the cost saving for the testing project.
Language-Independent: In API testing, data is exchanged using XML or JSON. These transfer modes are completely language-independent, allowing users to select any code language when adopting automation testing services for the project.
Easy Integration with GUI: API tests enable highly integrable tests, which is particularly useful if you want to perform functional GUI tests after API testing. For instance, simple integration would allow new user accounts to be created within the application before a GUI test started.
8. Some common protocols used in API testing?
Many protocols are now available to be used in API testing, such as JMS, REST, HTTP, UDDI and SOAP.

9. What is the test environment of API?
Setting up the API’s test environment is not an easy task, so you should have a ready answer if your API testing interview is coming. The test environment of API is a bit complete and requires the configuration of the database and server, depending on the software requirements. No GUI (Graphical User Interface) is available in this test form.

When the installation process is complete, API is verified for the proper operation. Throughout the process, the API called from the original environment is set up with different parameters to study the test results.  

10. What are principles of an API test design?
The five most important principles of an API test design are:

Setup: Create objects, start services, initialize data, etc
Execution: Steps to apply API or the scenario, including logging
Verification: Oracles to evaluate the result of the execution
Reporting: Pass, failed or blocked
Clean up: Pre-test state

11. What are the common API testing types?
While there are certainly specialty tests, and no list can be asked to be comprehensive in this realm, most tests fit broadly into these following nine categories that you should remember before attending in an API testing interview.

Validation Testing
Functional Testing
UI testing
Load testing
Runtime/ Error Detection
Security testing
Penetration testing
Fuzz testing
Interoperability and WS Compliance testing
12. What is the procedure to perform API testing?
Choose the suite to add the API test case
Choose the test development mode
Demand the development of test cases for the required API methods
Configure the control parameters of the application and then test conditions
Configure method validation
Execute the API test
Check test reports and filter API test cases
Arrange all API test cases
13. What must be checked when performing API testing?
During the API testing process, a request is raised to the API with the known data. This way you can analyze the validation response. While testing an API, you should consider:

Accuracy of data
Schema validation
HTTP status codes
Data type, validations, order and completeness
Authorization checks
Implementation of response timeout
Error codes in case API returns, and
Non-functional testing like performance and security testing
14. What is the best approach method to perform API testing?
The following factors should be considered when performing API testing:

Defining the correct input parameters
Verifying the calls of the mixture of two or more added value parameters
Defining the basic functionality and scope of the API program
Writing appropriate API test cases and making use of testing techniques such as equivalence class, boundary value, etc. to check the operability
Testing case execution
Comparing the test result with the expected result
Verifying the API behavior under conditions such as connection to files and so on.
15. What are tools could be used for API testing?
There are myriad of different API testing tools available. A few of common tools are Katalon Studio, Postman, SoapUi Pro, Apigee, etc.  While doing Unit and API testing, both targets source code. If an API method uses code based in .NET then another supporting tool must have .NET.

16. What are differences between API Testing and Unit Testing?

<img class="init-size aligncenter wp-image-4668 size-full" src="https://d1h3p5fzmizjvp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/04152227/API-Testing-vs-Unit-testing1.png" alt="api testing vs unit testing" width="645" height="325" srcset="https://d1h3p5fzmizjvp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/04152227/API-Testing-vs-Unit-testing1.png 645w, https://d1h3p5fzmizjvp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/04152227/API-Testing-vs-Unit-testing1-300x151.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px">

17. What are differences between API Testing and UI Testing?
API enables communication between two separate software systems. A software system implementing an API contains functions or subroutines that can be executed by another software system.
On the other hand, UI ( User Interface) testing refers to testing graphical interface such as how users interact with the applications, testing application elements like fonts, images, layouts etc. UI testing basically focuses on look and feel of an application.
18. What are major challenges faced in API testing?
If you can overcome the challenges in API Testing, you can be confident in the API testing interview too. They are:

Parameter Selection
Parameter Combination
Call sequencing
Output verification and validation
Another important challenge is providing input values, which is very difficult as GUI is not available in this case.
19. What are the testing methods that come under API testing?
One of the most common Web API testing interview questions is about the testing methods. They are:

Unit testing and Functional testing
Load testing to test the performance under load
Discovery testing to list, create and delete the number of calls documented in API
Usability and Reliability testing to get consistent results
Security and Penetration testing to validate all types of authentication
Automation testing to create and run scripts that require regular API calls
End to end Integration and Web UI testing
API documentation testing to determine its efficiency and effectiveness
20. Why is API testing considered as the most suitable form for Automation testing?
API testing is now preferred over GUI testing and is considered as most suitable because:

It verifies all the functional paths of the system under test very effectively.
It provides the most stable interface.
It is easier to maintain and provides fast feedback.
21. What are common API errors that often founded?
Not only API fundamental questions, the interviewer also determine your knowledge and experience by asking about the API errors in a Web API testing interview. So the most common ones are:

Missing module errors
Documentation errors
Parameter validation errors
And some standard error expectations as if the result is not so predicted then the occurrence of errors can be seen and for the same warnings are specified in the form of a message. There can be one or more warnings within an individual module.
22. What kinds of bugs that API testing would often find?
Missing or duplicate functionality
Fails to handle error conditions gracefully
Stress
Reliability
Security
Unused flags
Not implemented errors
Inconsistent error handling
Performance
Multi-threading issues
Improper errors

Documenting the API (Common Web API Testing interview questions)
23. What is API documentation?
The API documentation is a complete, accurate technical writing giving instructions on how to effectively use and integrate with an API. It is a compact reference manual that has all the information needed to work with the API, and helps you answer all the API testing questions with details on functions, classes, return types, arguments, and also examples and tutorials.

24. What are API documentation templates that are commonly used?
There are several available API documentation templates help to make the entire process simple and straightforward, which could be  answered in your API testing interview, such as:

Swagger
Miredot
Slate
FlatDoc
API blueprint
RestDoc
Web service API specification
25. When writing API document, what must be considered?
Source of the content
Document plan or sketch
Delivery layout
Information needed for every function in the document
Automatic document creation programs
26. How often are the APIs changed and, more importantly, deprecated?
APIs, especially modern RESTful APIs, are a nice creation that can certainly simplify and accelerate integration efforts, which makes it more likely you will benefit from them. But APIs can and do change for various reasons, sometimes abruptly, and hence REST APIs do not differ from traditional integration methods in this respect. If an API call is obsolete and disappears, your procedure will interrupt and it is important to understand how often the APIs you depend on change or are deprecated.

REST (Common Web API Testing interview questions)
27. What is REST?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for developing web services which exploit the ubiquity of HTTP protocol and uses HTTP method to define actions. It revolves around resource where every component being a resource that can be accessed through a shared interface using standard HTTP methods.

In REST architecture, a REST Server provides access to resources and REST client accesses and makes these resources available. Here, each resource is identified by URIs or global IDs, and REST uses multiple ways to represent a resource, such as text, JSON, and XML. XML and JSON are nowadays the most popular representations of resources.

28. What is a RESTFul Web Services?
Mostly, there are two kinds of Web Services which should be remembered in your next API testing interview:

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) – an XML-based method to expose web services.
Web services developed in the REST style are referred to as RESTful web services. These web services use HTTP methods to implement the concept of REST architecture. A RESTful web service usually defines a URI, Uniform Resource Identifier a service, provides resource representation like JSON and a set of HTTP methods.
29. What is a “Resource” in REST?
REST architecture treats any content as a resource, which can be either text files, HTML pages, images, videos or dynamic business information.
REST Server gives access to resources and modifies them, where each resource is identified by URIs/ global IDs.

30. What is the most popular way to represent a resource in REST?
REST uses different representations to define a resource like text, JSON, and XML.
XML and JSON are the most popular representations of resources.

31. Which protocol is used by RESTful Web services?
RESTful web services use the HTTP protocol as a medium of communication between the client and the server.

32. What are some key characteristics of REST?
Key characteristics of REST are likely asked in a Web API Testing interview. So please get the answer ready in your mind with these 2 ones:

REST is stateless, therefore the SERVER has no status (or session data)
With a well-applied REST API, the server could be restarted between two calls, since all data is transferred to the server
Web service uses POST method primarily to perform operations, while REST uses GET for accessing resources.
33. What is messaging in RESTful Web services?
RESTful web services use the HTTP protocol as a communication tool between the client and the server. The technique that when the client sends a message in the form of an HTTP Request, the server sends back the HTTP reply is called Messaging. These messages comprise message data and metadata, that is, information on the message itself.

34. What are the core components of an HTTP request?
An HTTP request contains five key elements:

An action showing HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which is the identifier for the resource on the server.
HTTP Version, which indicates HTTP version, for example-HTTP v1.1.
Request Header, which carries metadata (as key-value pairs) for the HTTP Request message. Metadata could be a client (or browser) type, format supported by the client, format of a message body format, cache settings, and so on.
Request Body, which indicates the message content or resource representation.
35. What are the most commonly used HTTP methods supported by REST?
GET is only used to request data from a specified resource. Get requests can be cached and bookmarked. It remains in the browser history and haS length restrictions. GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data.
POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource. POST requests are never cached and bookmarked and do not remain in the browser history.
PUT replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
DELETE removes the specified resource.
OPTIONS is used to describe the communication options for the target resource.
HEAD asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body.
36. Can GET request to be used instead of PUT to create a resource?
The PUT or POST method should be used to create a resource. GET is only used to request data from a specified resource.

37. Is there any difference between PUT and POST operations?
PUT and POST operation are quite similar, except the terms of the result generated by them.

PUT operation is idempotent, so you can cache the response while the responses to POST operation are not cacheable, and if you retry the request N times, you will end up having N resources with N different URIs created on server.

In a Web API Testing interview, you should give a specific example for PUT and POST operations to make crystal clear to the interviewer. Below is an example:

Scenario: Let’s say we are designing a network application. Let’s list down few URIs and their purpose to get to know when to use POST and when to use PUT operations.

GET /device-management/devices : Get all devices
POST /device-management/devices : Create a new device

GET /device-management/devices/{id} : Get the device information identified by “id”
PUT /device-management/devices/{id} : Update the device information identified by “id”
DELETE /device-management/devices/{id} : Delete device by “id”

38. Which purpose does the OPTIONS method serve for the RESTful Web services?
The OPTIONS Method lists down all the operations of a web service supports. It creates read-only requests to the server.

39. What is URI? What is the main purpose of REST-based web services and what is its format?
URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier. It is a string of characters designed for unambiguous identification of resources and extensibility via the URI scheme.

The purpose of a URI is to locate a resource(s) on the server hosting of the web service.

A URI’s format is <protocol>://<service-name>/<ResourceType>/<ResourceID>. 

40. What is payload in RESTFul Web services?
The “payload” is the data you are interested in transporting. This is differentiated from the things that wrap the data for transport like the HTTP/S Request/Response headers, authentication, etc.

41. What is the upper limit for a payload to pass in the POST method?
<GET> appends data to the service URL. But, its size shouldn’t exceed the maximum URL length. However, <POST> doesn’t have any such limit.

So, theoretically, a user can pass unlimited data as the payload to POST method. But, if we consider a real use case, then sending POST with large payload will consume more bandwidth. It’ll take more time and present performance challenges to your server. Hence, a user should take action accordingly.

42. What is the caching mechanism?
Caching is just the practice of storing data in temporarily and retrieving data from a high-performance store (usually memory) either explicitly or implicitly.

When a caching mechanism is in place, it helps improve delivery speed by storing a copy of the asset you requested and later accessing the cached copy instead of the original. 

SOAP (Common Web API Testing interview questions)
43. What are SOAP Web services?
This is one of the fundamental Web services testing questions that you must know the answer. The SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is defined as an XML-based protocol. It is known for designing and developing web services as well as enabling communication between applications developed on different platforms using various programming languages over the Internet. It is both platform and language independent.

44. How does SOAP work?
SOAP is used to provide a user interface that can be accessed by the client object, and the request that it sends goes to the server, which can be accessed using the server object. The user interface creates some files or methods consisting of server object and the name of the interface to the server object. It also contains other information such as the name of the interface and methods. It uses HTTP to send the XML to the server using the POST method, which analyzes the method and sends the result to the client. The server creates more XML consisting of responses to the request of user interface using HTTP. The client can use any approach to send the XML, like the SMTP server or POP3 protocol to pass the messages or reply to queries.

45. When to use SOAP API?
Use the SOAP API to create, retrieve, update or delete records, like accounts, leads, and user-defined objects. With more than 20 different calls, you can also use the SOAP API to manage passwords, perform searches, etc. by using the SOAP API in any language that supports web services.

46. How users utilize the facilities provided by SOAP?
PutAddress(): It is used to enter an address in the webpage and has an address instance on the SOAP call.
PutListing(): It is used to allow the insertion of a complete XML document into the web page. It receives the XML file as an argument and transports the XML file to XML parser liaison, which reads it and inserts it into the SOAP call as a parameter.
GetAddress(): It is used to get a query name and gets the result that best matches a query. The name is sent to the SOAP call in the form of text character string.
GetAllListing(): It is used to return the full list in an XML format.
47. What is the major obstacle users faced when using SOAP?
When using SOAP, users often see the firewall security mechanism as the biggest obstacle. This block all the ports leaving few like HTTP port 80 and the HTTP port used by SOAP that bypasses the firewall. The technical complaint against SOAP is that it mixes the specification for message transport with the specification for message structure.

48. What are the various approaches available for developing SOAP based web services?
There are two different methods available for developing SOAP-based web services, which are explained below:

Contract-first approach: the contract is first defined by XML and WSDL, and then Java classes are derived from the contract.
Contract-last approach: Java classes are first defined, and then the contract is generated, which is normally the WSDL file from the Java class.
“Contract-first” method is the most popular approach.

49. What are the elements of a SOAP message structure?
It is a common XML document that contains the elements as a SOAP message

Envelope: It is an obligatory root element that translates the XML document and defines the beginning and end of the message.

Header: It is an optional item which contains information about the message being sent.

Body: It contains the XML data comprising the message being sent.

Fault: It provides the information on errors that occurred while during message processing.

50. What are the syntax rules for a SOAP message?
Must use encoded XML
Envelope namespace must be used
Encoding namespace must be used
Must not consist of a DTD reference
Must not have XML processing instruction
51. What is the transport method in SOAP?
Application layer and transport layers of a network are used by SOAP; HTTP and SMTP are the valid protocol of the application layer used as the transport for SOAP. HTTP is more preferable, since it works well with the current Internet infrastructure, in particular with firewalls.
The SOAP requests can be sent using an HTTP GET method while the specification only contains details about HTTP POST.

52. What are some important characteristics of a SOAP envelope element?
SOAP message has a root Envelope element
Envelope is an obligatory part of the SOAP message.
If an envelope includes a header element, it should not contain more than one.
Envelope version will change if the SOAP version changes.
The SOAP envelope is indicated by the prefix ENV and the envelope element.
The optional SOAP encoding is also specified using a namespace and the optional encoding style element.
53. What are the major functionalities provided by the SOAP protocol class?
The SOAP protocol is used to provide simple access methods for all the applications available on the Internet, providing the following functionalities:

Call: A class which provides the main functionality for a remote method for which a call is needed. It is used to create the call() and to specify the encoding style of the registry that will be assigned when if necessary. This call() function is used by the RPC call, which represents the options of the call object.
Deployment Descriptor: A class used to provide the information about the SOAP services. It enables easy deployment without the need for other approaches.
DOM2 Writer: A class that serializes and uses DOM node as XML string to provide more functionalities.
RPC Message: A class used as the base class that calls and replies to the request submitted to the server.
Service Manager: A class that provides, lists and then outputs all SOAP services.
54. What are the web relation functionalities provided by SOAP protocol?
HTTPUtils: This provides the functionality of the POST method to safely meet the requirements.
Parameter: It is an argument for an RPC call used by both the client and the server.
Response: It is an object that represents an RPC reply from both client and server, but the result will not be displayed until after the method call.
TCPTunnel: It is an object that provides the ability to listen on a specific port and to forward all the host and port names.
TypeConverter: It helps to convert an object of one type into another type and this is called using the class in the form object.
55. How does the message security model allow the creation of SOAP more secure to use?
The security model includes the given security tokens. These tokens comprise digital signatures for protection and authentication of SOAP messages. Security tokens can be used to provide the bond between authentication secrets or keys and security identities. Security token uses the authentication protocols and an X.509 certificate to define the relationship between the public key and identity key. The signatures are used to verify the messages and their origin, generate knowledge to confirm the security tokens to bind the identity of a person to the identity of the originator. Security model prevents different attacks and can be used to protect the SOAP architecture.

56. What is the difference between top down & bottom up approach in SOAP Web services?
Top down SOAP Web services include creating WSDL document to create a contract between the web service and the client, with a required code as an option. This is also known as Contract-first approach. The top-down approach is difficult to implement because classes must be written to confirm the contract defined in WSDL. One of the benefits of this method is that both client and server code can be written in parallel.
Bottom up SOAP web services require the code to be written first and then WSDL is generated. It is also known as Contract-last approach. Since WSDL is created based on the code, bottom-up approach is easy to implement and client codes must wait for WSDL from the server side to start working.
57. What are advantages of SOAP?
SOAP is both platform and language independent.
SOAP separates the encoding and communications protocol from the runtime environment.
Web service can retrieve or receive a SOAP user data from a remote service, and the source’s platform information is completely independent of each other.
Everything can generate XML, from Perl scripts through C++ code to J2EE app servers.
It uses XML to send and receive messages.
It uses standard internet HTTP protocol.
SOAP runs over HTTP; it eliminates firewall problems. When protocol HTTP is used as the protocol binding, an RPC call will be automatically assigned to an HTTP request, and the RPC response will be assigned to an HTTP reply.
Compared to RMI, CORBA and DCOM, SOAP is very easy to use.
SOAP acts as a protocol to move information in a distributed and decentralized environment.
SOAP is independent of the transport protocol and can be used to coordinate different protocols.
58. What are disadvantages of SOAP?
SOAP is typically significantly slower than other types of middleware standards, including CORBA, because SOAP uses a detailed XML format. A complete understanding of the performance limitations before building applications around SOAP is hence required.

SOAP is usually limited to pooling and not to event notifications when HTTP is used for the transport. In addition, only one client can use the services of one server in typical situations.

If HTTP is used as the transport protocol, firewall latency usually occurs since the firewall analyzes the HTTP transport. This is because HTTP is also leveraged for Web browsing, and so many firewalls do not understand the difference between using HTTP within a web browser and using HTTP within SOAP.

SOAP has different support levels, depending on the supported programming language. For instance, SOAP supported in Python and PHP is not as powerful as it is in Java and .NET

59. What are the differences between SOAP and REST?

60. SOAP or Rest APIs, which method to use?
SOAP is the heavyweight choice for Web service access. It provides the following advantages when compared to REST:

SOAP is not very easy to implement and requires more bandwidth and resources.
SOAP message request is processed slower as compared to REST and it does not use web caching mechanism.
WS-Security: While SOAP supports SSL (just like REST) it also supports WS-Security which adds some enterprise security features.
WS-AtomicTransaction: Need ACID Transactions over a service, you’re going to need SOAP.
WS-ReliableMessaging: If your application needs Asynchronous processing and a guaranteed level of reliability and security. Rest doesn’t have a standard messaging system and expects clients to deal with communication failures by retrying.
If the security is a major concern and the resources are not limited then we should use SOAP web services. Like if we are creating a web service for payment gateways, financial and telecommunication related work, then we should go with SOAP as here high security is needed.
REST is easier to use for the most part and is more flexible. It has the following advantages when compared to SOAP:

Since REST uses standard HTTP, it is much simpler.
REST is easier to implement, requires less bandwidth and resources.
REST permits many different data formats whereas SOAP only permits XML.
REST allows better support for browser clients due to its support for JSON.
REST has better performance and scalability. REST reads can be cached, SOAP based reads cannot be cached.
If security is not a major concern and we have limited resources. Or we want to create an API that will be easily used by other developers publicly then we should go with REST.
If we need Stateless CRUD operations then go with REST.
REST is commonly used in social media, web chat, mobile services and Public APIs like Google Maps.
RESTful service returns various MediaTypes for the same resource, depending on the request header parameter “Accept” as application/xml or application/json for POST and /user/1234.json or GET /user/1234.xml for GET.
REST services are meant to be called by the client-side application and not the end user directly.
ST in REST comes from State Transfer. You transfer the state around instead of having the server store it, this makes REST services scalable.
61. What are the factors that help to decide which style of Web services – SOAP or REST – to use?
Generally, REST is preferred due to its simplicity, performance, scalability, and support for multiple data formats.

However, SOAP is favorable to use where service requires an advanced level of security and transactional reliability.

But you can read the following facts before opting for any of the styles.

Does the service expose data or business logic? REST is commonly used for exposing data while SOAP for logic.
The requirement from clients or providers for a formal contract. SOAP can provide contract via WSDL.
Support multiple data formats.
Support for AJAX calls. REST can apply the XMLHttpRequest.
Synchronous and asynchronous calls. SOAP enables both synchronous/ asynchronous operations whereas REST has built-in support for synchronous.
Stateless or Stateful calls. REST is suited for stateless operations.
Security. SOAP provides a high level of security.
Transaction support. SOAP is good at transaction management.
Limited bandwidth. SOAP has a lot of overhead when sending/receiving packets since it’s XML based, requires a SOAP header. However, REST requires less bandwidth to send requests to the server. Its messages are mostly built using JSON.
Ease of use. REST based application is easy to implement, test, and maintain.

*****************************************************************************************************

A list of frequently asked API Testing interview questions and answers are given below.

1) What is API?
API (Application Programming Interface) helps in communication and data exchange between two software systems. API act as an interface between two applications and allows the two software systems communicate with one another. API is a collection of functions which can be executed by another software program.

API works as; it takes a request from the source, takes that request to the database, fetches the request data from the database and returns a response to the source. API takes the requests from the user and gives the response without exposing the internal details. API acts as Abstraction.

Example: Amazon API, Google Map API

2) What is API testing?
API testing is a type of software testing that involves testing APIs directly. API is a part of integration testing to check whether the API meets expectations in terms of functionality, reliability, performance, and security of applications. Multiple API system can performed API testing. In API testing, our primary focus is on Business Logic Layer of the software architecture.

3) What are the types of API testing?
API testing involves the following types of testing:

Unit Testing
Functional Testing
Load Testing
Runtime/Error Detection
Security Testing
UI Testing
Interoperability and WS compliance Testing
Penetration Testing
Fuzz Testing
4) What are the protocols used in API Testing?
Protocols used in API testing are:

HTTP
REST
SOAP
JMS
UDDI
5) What are the tools used for API Testing?
Tools used for API testing are:

Parasoft SOAtest
PostMan
AlertSite API monitoring
6) What is API test environment?
For API the test environment is a quite complex method where the configuration of server and database is done as per the requirement of the software application. API testing does not involve graphical user interface (GUI).

API is checked for its proper functioning after installation.

7) What is API framework?
API framework is described by the config. File which consist of the list of all APIs that are required to be activated and are activated for any particular program run. This is essential as every test run does not require all APIs.

8) What are the limits of API usage?
Many APIs have certain limit set up by the provider. Hence, try to estimate our usage and understand how that will impact the overall cost of the offering.

9) What are the advantages of API testing?
Advantages of API testing are:

Test for core functionality: API testing provides access to the application without the user interface. The core functionality of the application will be tested before the GUI tests. This will help to detect the minor issue which can become bigger during the GUI testing.
Time effective: API testing is less time consuming than GUI testing. Particularly, API test requires less code so it can provide better and faster test coverage compare to GUI test automation. This will reduce the cost for the testing project.
Language Independent: In API testing data is exchange using XML or JSON. These transfer mode are completely language-independent, which allows users to select any code language when adopting automation test service for the project.
Easy Integration with GUI: API tests provide highly integrable tests which is useful to perform functional GUI tests after GUI tests. Simple integration would allow new user accounts to be created within the application before GUI started.
10) What are the principles of an API test design?
Here, are the seven principles of API test design.

Exhaustive Testing: Exhaustive testing is not possible. Instead we need optimal amount of testing which is based on the risk assessment of the application.
Defect Clustering: Defect Clustering states that a small number of modules contain the most of the defect detected. Approximately 80% of the defect found in 20% of the modules. By experience we can identify such risky modules. But this approach has its own problems. If the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually the same test case will no longer find new bugs.
Pesticide Paradox: Testers cannot depend on existing technique. They must have to look continually to improve the existing method to make testing more effective. But even all these hard work in testing we can never claim our product is bug free. To overcome this, test cases need to be regularly reviewed and revised add new and different test cases to help find more defects.
Testing shows presence of defects: Testing principle states that- testing talks about the presence of defects not about the absence of defect. Software testing reduces the probability of undiscovered defects remaining in the software but even if no defects found, it is not a proof of correctness.
But if we work hard, taking all precautions and make our software products 99% bug free. The software does not meet the needs and requirements of the client.
Absence of error -fallacy: This can be possible the software which is 99% bug free is still unusable. The case can be if the system is tested for the wrong requirement. Software testing is not finding the defects but also to check that software addresses the business needs. The absence of error is fallacy i.e. finding and fixing defects does not help if the system build is unusable and doesn't fulfill the user's needs and requirements.
Early Testing: Testing should start as soon as possible in the software development lifecycle. So that defects in the requirement or design phase captured in the early stages. It is cheaper to fix defect in the early stages of testing. We should start finding the bug at the moment the requirements are defined.
Testing is context dependent: Testing is context dependent that we test an e-commerce site will be different from the way we test the commercial. All the developed software's are not identical. We will use different methodology; techniques and type of testing depend on the application type.
11) What is API framework?
A framework or software framework is a platform for developing software applications. API framework is a foundation on which software developer can build applications for a specific platform.

Example: A framework can include predefined classes and functions that can be used to process input, manage hardware devices and interact with system software.

Framework is similar to an Application Programming Interface, technically framework includes API. Framework serves foundation for programming while API provides access to the elements supported by the framework. Framework also includes code libraries, compiler and other programs used in the software development process.

API framework is defined by configuration file which consists the list of all APIs that is required to be activated and activated for a particular program run.

12) What are the common tests that performed on API?
Here, are the common tests that performed on API are as:

Response of the API should be verified based on the request. We will verify that the return value is based on request.
When API is updating any data structure we should verify the system is authenticating the outcome.
We will verify whether the API is trigger other event or request another API.
We will verify the behavior of the API when no value is return.
13) What exactly needs to verify in API testing?
In API testing, we send a request to API with the known data and then analysis the response.

We will verify the accuracy of the data.
Will see the HTTP status code.
We will see the response time.
Error codes in case API returns any errors.
Authorization would be check.
Non-Functional testing such as performance testing, security testing.

14) What are the differences between API and Web Services?

</tbody></table>


15) What is API documentation?
A good documentation is must for any foundation. API documentation serves as quick reference for accessing library or working within a program.

When we use any such documents, it must consists of proper plan, content source, proper layout, information related to each function etc.

There are various documentation tools like Doxygen and JavaDoc. Here, are the functions which are documented which revolve around the parameters like:

Function description
Type and syntax of error message that may occure
Syntax, elements and sequence needed for each parameter
Links regarding functions
16) What is the most used template for API documentation?
Here, are the various documentation template that make the whole process simple and easy. They are:

Swagger
Miredot
Slate
FlatDoc
API blueprint
RestDoc
Web service API specification
17) What are the types of bug that can be found during API testing?
API testing helps us to find many types of bugs which are:

Stress
Security
Duplicate or missing functionality
Reliability
Unused flags
Performance
Incompatible error handling
Multi-threaded issue
Improper errors
18) What are the difference between API testing and UI testing?
UI (User Interface) testing means the testing of the graphical user interface. The focus of UI testing is on the look and feel of the application. In user interface testing the main focus is on how users can interact with app elements such as images, fonts, layout etc. are checked.

API testing allows the communication between two software systems. API testing works on backend also known as backend testing.

19) What is SOAP?
SOAP (Simple Object Access Control) . It is an XML based protocol that helps in exchanging information among computers.

20) What is REST API?
REST API is a set of function helps the developers performing requests when the response is receiving. Through HTTP protocol interaction is made in REST API.

REST is defined as Representational state transfer. It is an effective standard for API creation.

21) What are the differences between SOAP and REST API?

</tr>
</tbody></table>


22) What are the major challenges faced during API testing?
The major challenges faced during the API testing are:

Parameter Selection
Parameter Combination
Call sequencing
Output verification and validation
A major challenge is providing input values which are very difficult because GUI is not available.

	<td><strong>4.</strong></td>
	<td>API testing is done by the testers. The whole purpose of API testing is end to end testing of the functionality.</td>
	<td>Unit testing is done by the developer. In unit testing every functionality is separately tested.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

24) What is a RESTFUL web services?
There are two kinds of web services

SOAP Web Services
RESTFUL Web Services
1. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) - SOAP is a XML based method which is used in Web Services.

2. RESTFUL Web Services - To implement the concept of REST architecture HTTP method is used. RESTFUL Web Services defines URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), and also provides resource representation like JSON and a set of HTTP method.

25) What is Resource in REST?
REST architecture treats any content as resource, which can be text files, HTML pages, images, videos or dynamic business information. REST server gives the functionality to access the resources and modifies them. We can identify the each resources by URIs/ global IDs.

26) What is the way to represent the resource in REST?
REST uses different representation to define the resources like text, JSON and XML. The most popular representation of resources is JSON and XML.

27) What protocol is used by the RESTFUL Web Services?
RESTFUL Web Services uses the HTTP protocol. They use the HTTP protocol as a medium of communication between the client and the server.

28) What are the characteristics of REST?
Here, are the two characteristics of REST.

REST is stateless. With the use of the REST API the server has no status, we can restart the server between two calls, inspite of all the data is transferred to the server.
Web Services uses POST method to perform operations, while REST uses GET method to access the resources.
29) What is messaging in RESTFUL Web Services?
RESTFUL Web Services use the HTTP protocol as a communication tool between the client and the server. This is the technique when the client sends a message in the form of HTTP request the server send back the HTTP reply which is called Messaging. This message consists message data and Meta data i.e. information on the message itself.

30) What are the components of an HTTP request?
An HTTP request have five components. These are:

Action showing HTTP method like GET, PUT, POST, DELETE.
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): URI is the identifier for the resource on the server.
HTTP version: Indicate the HTTP version like- HTTP V1.1.
Request Header: Request Header carries metadata for the HTTP request message. Metadata could be a client type, format supported by the client, format of a message body, cache setting etc.
Request Body: Resource body indicates message content or resource representation.
31) What is the HTTP protocol supported by REST?
GET: GET is used to request data from the specified resource.

GET request can be cached and bookmark. It remains in the browser history and has length restriction. When dealing with sensitive data GET requests should not be used.

POST: POST is used to send data to server for creation or updating the resources.

POST requests are never cached or bookmark.

PUT: PUT replaces the current representation of the target resource with the request payload.

DELETE: DELETE removes the specified resource.

OPTIONS: OPTION is used to describe the communication option for the target resources.

HEAD: HEAD asks for response which is identical to GET requests, but without the response body.

32) Can we use GET request instead of PUT to create a resource?
PUT or POST method is used create a resource. GET is only used to request the resources.

33) What is URI? What is the purpose of web-based service and what is it's format?
URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier. It is a string of characters designed for unambiguous identification of resources and extensibility by the URI scheme. The purpose of URI is to locate the resource on the server hosting of the web service.

A URIs format is <protocol>://<service-name>/<Resource Type>/<ResourceID>

34) What are SOAP Web Services?
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is defined as the XML based protocol. SOAP is also known for developing and designing web services and also enable the communication between the applications developed on different platform by using different programming languages on the internet. SOAP is platform and language independent.

35) When we can use SOAP API?
We can use SOAP API to perform the operation on records like create, retrieve, update or delete. We can use API to manage password, perform searches etc.

********************************************

1). How can you define the API testing for software projects?

API testing for any software project specifies how different components of a project should interact with each other. Testing the functionality of these components or functions is named as the API testing.

2). Name API testing tools that are frequently used by developers?

The API testing tools that are frequently used by developers include – PostMan, Alertsite API monitoring, SoapUI Pro etc.

3). Do you know about the common tests performed on the APIs?

Here is the list of common tests that are performed on APIs –

You should verify the API first and check either it is updating any data structure or not.
You need to check either API returns anything.
As per the given parameters or values, the values returned by APIs need to check.
Verify the API either it triggers any other event or calling another API.
4). What is a SOAP web service?

SOAP means Simple Object Access Control Protocol and this is an XML-based protocol that is used to exchange information between computer machines.

5). What do you understand by the REST API?

Rest API is defined as the set of functions that helps a developer in sending requests and receiving responses. In this protocol, the interaction is always made through an HTTP protocol. The meaning of REST is Representable State Transfer that has become a defacto standard for API creation these days.

6). How will you differentiate the API testing and the UI testing from each other?

UI or User-Interface testing is used to check the graphical interface of an application or software program how user interacts and reacts to different elements like fonts, images, layouts etc. This testing is majorly focused on look and feel of an application.

At the same time, API enables the communication among two different software components. Any software system implementing API contains functions or sub-routines that can be executed any other software system.

7). How will you differentiate the API testing and the Unit testing from each other?

Here are the major differences between API testing and the Unit testing. Let us discuss on each of them one by one –

API Testing

This type of testing is owned by the QA team.
This is an example of black box testing.
API testing is related to checking the full functionalities of a system so that it can be perfectly used by end users.
API testing is performed once the build is ready and authors don’t have the access to source code anymore.
Unit Testing

This type of testing is owned by the development team.
This is an example of white box testing.
Unit testing is performed to check either each unit is isolated and performing as per the expectation.
Unit testing is performed after each of the modules is ready before it is converted to a build.
8). When you are writing an API document, what are the major areas to focus on?

Here is the list of major areas that you should focus on while writing an API document –

Focus on the content source
Sketch or document the plan well.
Layout delivery
Detailed information about each of the functions
Automatic document creation programs
9). For any API document, how can we document different functions?

Syntax – Here, you have to write the syntax for the parameter of the code in the same sequence as they occur, highlight necessary elements, optional elements etc.
Description – Give a quick description of each of the functions
Error Messages – Here you need to give syntax of error messages.
Parameters – Give proper details about function parameters.
Related Links – Connection fields
Example Code – A small snippet of the code
10). Mention the list of tools that are needed for the documentation.

For Java Code, you can use JavaDoc and for the .Net code, you can use Doxygen.

B. Advanced API Testing Interview Questions and Answers
11). What is the basic process to test an API? Explain based on your previous experiences.

Here are the basic steps to follow to test an API –

First of all, decide the suite where you wanted to add the API test case.
Now select the test development code too.
Now you have to develop test cases for needed API methods.
This is the time to configure the app control parameters.
Configure the test conditions too.
Validate the methods and configure them
Execute APIs, check the test reports, filter the test cases, arrange the test cases etc.
By following these steps in the same sequence as given, this is easy to test an API successfully.

12). What do you understand by the API Framework?

There is no need to give an introduction to the API Framework as it is self-explanatory. When you are testing APIs then you don’t have to work on each API independently but you can use config files in that case where details for all APIs are given and can be used if needed.

13). Explain the working of API builder.

API builder is PL SQL program that is made up of four SQL files where one file is responsible for starting the process, two files are used to create the temp tables or the master package, and the fourth file will help in generating the final output.

14). What is a Test API?

Test API is a set of test APIs or a library of utility that helps developers or testers in creating testing tools and automated test cases for .Net or WIN 32 applications. It also offers a set of basic building blocks, data structures, data types, algorithms etc.

15). What are the different types of Input Injection and what are the different ways of stimulating user input?

Input injection is a popular act of simulating user inputs and it can be done in popular ways as listed below –

By direct method invocation
With the help of an accessibility interface
By simulating low-level input
By simulating a device driver
Simulation using a robot
16). What are the different types of challenges faced by developers during API testing?

The different type of challenges faced by developers during API testing include –

Developers are not sure how to select the parameters?
They are not sure how to combine the parameters?
Developers are not sure of call sequencing.
