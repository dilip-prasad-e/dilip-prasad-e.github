1. What is HP ALM (Quality Center) used for? Or What are the benefits and features of Quality Center?

HP ALM/ Quality Center is a comprehensive test management tool. It is a web-based tool and supports high level of communication 
and association among various stakeholders (Business Analyst, Developers , Testers etc. ) , driving a more effective and efficient
 global application-testing process. Automation Tools like QTP , WinRunner & Loadrunner can be integrated with Quality Center. 
 One can also create reports and graphs for Analysis and Tracking for Test processes.

2. What is the difference between TestDirector and Quality Center?

Quality Center is upgraded version of Test Director built by the same vendor Mercury (Now acquired by HP).Test Director Version 
8.2 onwards is know as Quality Center. Quality Center is has enhanced Security/Test management /Defect management features when 
compared to Test Director.

3. What is the difference between Quality Center and Bugzilla?

Quality Center is a test management tool which can also manage Defects apart from other features.

BugZilla is Defect Management tool only.

4. What is the Purpose of Creating Child Requirement in TD /QC?

By Creating Child requirements to the main requirement you can evaluate the sub requirements related to the main requirements.

You can link test sets and defects to the sub-requirements.  This helps in 100% test coverage and its analysis.

Learn More About Requirements in the Tutorial here

5. What is Test Lab?

In order to execute a Test Case (Developed in the Test Plan Module) either manual or automated it needs to imported into Test 
Lab Module. In sum, Test Cases are created in Test Plan Module while they are executed in Test Lab Module.

6. What is meant by Instance?
A Test Case imported from Test Plan module to Test Lab module is called an Instance of that test case. It is possible to have 
multiple instances of the same Test Case in the Test Lab Module.

 

7. Is it possible to maintain test data in Quality Center?
Yes. One can attach the test data to the corresponding test cases or create a separate folder in test plan to store them.

 

8. How to ensure that there is no duplication of bugs in Quality Center?

In the defect tracking window of QC,  there is a "find similar defect" icon. When this icon is clicked after writing the defect,
 if anybody else has entered the same defect then it points it out.

 

9. What will be the status in Quality Center if you give "Suggestion" to the Developer?

This is a trick question.

You can give "Suggestion" to the developer using the Comments sections provided in QC. This is will not change the current 
status of Defect in QC. In sum, the status of the defect remains the same,  as that  before giving suggestion to the developer.

10. How will you generate the defect ID in Quality Center?

The Defect ID is automatically generated after clicking Submit button.

11. Is 'Not covered' and 'Not run' status the same?
Not Covered status means all those requirements for which the test cases are not written whereas Not Run status means all 
those requirements for which test cases are written but are not run.
 

12.How to import test cases from Excel / Word  to Quality Center?

1.Install and Configure the Microsoft Excel / Word Add-In for Quality Center.

2. Map the Columns in  Word / Excel spreadsheet with Columns available  in  Quality Center

3.Export the data from Word/Excel to Quality Center Using Tools >Export to Quality Center Option in Word/Excel.
4. Rectify errors if Any.
 

13. Can we export the file from Quality Centre to Excel / Word. If yes then how?

Yes.

Requirement tab- Right click on main Req/click on export/save as word, excel or other template. This would save all the 
child requirements

Test plan tab: Only individual test can be exported. No parent child export is possible. Select a test script, click on 
the design steps tab, right click anywhere on the open window. Click on export and save as.

Test lab tab: Select a child group. Click on execution grid if it is not selected. Right click anywhere. Default save 
option is excel. But can be saved in documents and other formats


Defects Tab: Right click anywhere on the window, export all or selected defects and save excel sheet or document.
 

14. What is Business Component  ?

Quality Center provides Business Component  for Business Process Testing (BPT).

Many Enterprise Applications are a) complex and b) require extensive test scripts/case.

A Test /Automation Engineer can not handle both complexity of Application Under Test as well as  extensive test script/test
 case creation.

Using Business Component,  Subject Matter Experts ( who are experts on the  Application  Under Test ) can create tests 
in a script free environment without involving in the Nitty-gritty of test case/script designing. It helps increase test 
coverage and creates re-usable business components used for testing essential Business Processes.

Development of Test Script / Cases is done by Automation / Test Engineer.

15.How can we save the tests Executed in test lab?

The tests executed, are automatically saved when the user clicks on "END RUN" in the Test Lab

16. How to export test cases from QTP into QC?

To export test cases from QTP to QC, you first need to establish QTP-QC connection

1)  In QTP , Go to File > Quality Center Connection.

2)  Enter QC URL project name/domain/username/password and click on Login. QTP is now connected to QC.

Next you can select the save the QTP Script in QC.

3)  In QTP, Select File Menu > Save As > Save in QC

4 ) Select the Folder in QC where you wan to save the QTP Script

19. What is the main purpose to storing requirement in Quality Center?

You store requirements in Quality Center for following reasons

a) To ensure 100% coverage : You can create and track test plan / sets for the requirements stored in Quality Center to 
ensure all the requirements are tested.

b) Easy Change Management : If any requirement changes during course of test case creation , the underlying test case 
is automatically highlighted and Test Engineer can change the test case to suite the new requirement.

e) Ease of Tracking : Using Advanced Reporting & Graphs provided by QC , Managers can determine various metrics useful 
in project tracking and monitoring.

 

20. What is Coverage status, what does it do?

Coverage status is percentage of testing covered at a given time.

For Example, If you have 100 test cases in a project and you have executed 35 test cases than your coverage status of 
the project is 35%

Coverage status is helps keep track of project deadline.

There are many releases for a specific product
Each release is segregated into a number of cycles
Each release has also have a pre-defined scope and milestone associated with it
There is a specific number of test cases and requirements associated with it
Upon executing tests, the defects are mapped and logged to the corresponding tests after which we can trace requirements 
and defects
Hence we need release and cycle Management

 

25. Explain how you can customize the defect management cycle in Quality Center?

 

One should gather all the features or attributes that have to be part of the defect management like defect origin, version, 
defect details, etc.  Later in QC using the modify options, one can change the defect modules accordingly.
