1) Mention the responsibilities of the Test Manager?

Role of QA Manager includes

Manage project from initiation through closure
Test planning
Obtain customer acceptance of the deliverables
Approve intermediate deliverables and patch releases to the client
Submit effort inputs for billing
Issue Management
Mentoring, coaching and off-shore team management
Submit reports for weekly status to the test coordinators
Participating in weekly review meetings
Publish KPIs for all testing projects on a weekly basis
Resource mobilization for projects
2) Mention what is your approach if you find that the testers in your organization are performing a test on the deliverable
 even after significant defect have been identified?

As a QA Lead, your approach should be

Acceptance criteria should be tightened
Test cases should be re-evaluated
More test cases should be added if possible, with equivalence class partition cases and boundary values
More test cases should be added to check invalid conditions.
Show Stopper criteria should be modified
3) Mention what Requirement Traceability Matrix is?

Requirement Traceability Matrix is linking of requirement documents to test cases. It is used for the following reason

To ensure that all the application requirements are tested in the verification process
To check Test Coverage
4) How would you select a Testing tool for your project?

Identify features required in an automation tool as per the project needs
Evaluate commercial and noncommercial tools that meet the requirements
Estimate cost and benefit of the tool. Cost could include licenses and training.
Make the final decision in consultation with team members.
5) What are some key challenges in a Testing Project?

Key challenges of software testing include

Testing phase us usually under a time constraint
Understanding the requirements can sometimes be a challenge
Application should be stable enough to be tested
Setting priorities for testing
Lack of skilled testers
Regression Testing
Frequent Requirements changing
Lack of tools, resource, and training

6) What is a Test Plan?

The test plan is a document describing the activities and the testing scope. It is the basic requirement for testing any 
software product.

7) What are types of the test plan?

There are three main types of Test Plan

Master Test Plan
Testing level specific Test Plan
Testing type specific test plans
8) What people skills should a Test Manager have?

Effective and clear communication
Should build good relationship with team members
Good listening skills and emotional intelligence
Motivate team members
Resolve conflicts and ethical issues.
9) What is 'Configuration Management'?

Configuration Management covers the processes used to coordinate, control, and track test artifacts.

The test artifacts could include automation Code, requirements, documentation, problems, designs, change requests, 
designs, etc.

10) What is PDCA model?

The PDCA model stands for

Plan: Identify improvements and set targets
Do: Implement improvements
Check: Check result of improvements
Act: Learn from results
It is a Test Process Improvement (TPI) method.

11) What are informal reviews?

An informal review is a way of checking for defects without running code. Informal reviews are implemented many times during 
the initial stages of the test life cycle of the document. Informal reviews are not documented.

12) Mention the types of Risk in a Test Project

The types of Risk in a Test Project can be broadly categorized as

Strategy Risk: This includes Budget, Communication and Management risks
Project Definition Risks: This includes Project target, Scope, and requirements risks.
Human Resources Risk: This includes Skill, Team members and organization risks.
Project Schedule Risks.
13) What are the countermeasures that test manager should take against risks?

Test manager must take following steps to mitigate the risk while developing product

Avoidance: Eliminate the risk factor that is involved
Reduction: Mitigation plan to decrease the impact of risks and to take corrective measures
Sharing: Transfer the risk to another resource such as insource or insure
Accept: Accept the risk and prepare a planned budget for these risks
14) Explain how test manager can estimate the project and what to estimate?

During Test Estimation, a Test Manager must evaluate four things

Cost
Resources
Human Skills
Time
They can estimate the project in following ways

Work breakdown structure (WBS): Breaking down project into smaller segments
Three-point estimation: Three-point estimation is based on statistical data
Functional point method: Give weightage to each function and measure the size
15) What is three-point estimation?

In the three-point estimation, three values are initially produced for every task based on previous experience. For example, 
to complete a specific task the different possibilities are

Best case estimate: 120 man-hours or 15 days with experienced team members
The most likely estimate: 170 hours or 21 days with enough resources and moderate team members experience
The worst-case estimate: 200 man-hours or 25 days and with a team that has lesser work experience
16) Mention some of the best practices for test estimation

Some of the best practices for Test Estimation is

Add some buffer time: Having a buffer time is always an advantage, it may help to deal with a delay caused due to 
unexpected reason like talented member quits the job suddenly,
Account resource planning in estimation: Make sure that your estimation is realistic and considered crucial factors 
like availability of human resource.
Use the past experience reference: Through your past experience try to avoid all the obstacles or possible hindrance 
that are most likely to happen
Stick to your estimation: Estimation is not full proof. It may go wrong also. In the early phase of the project, you 
should re-check the test estimation and if required make modifications as well.
17) What does a good test report include?

A good test report should include

Project Information
Test Objective
Test Summary
Defect
18) List out some of the software quality assurance best practice?

Some of the best practices for software Quality Assurance includes

Continuous Improvement
Documentation
Tool usage and automation
Metrics
Team work and shared responsibility for SQA
19) By what factors you can determine the quality of the test execution?

Two ways can determine the quality of test execution

Defect rejection ratio: (No. of defects rejected/ total no. of defects raised) X 100
Defect leakage ratio: (No. of defect missed/total defects of software) X 100
20) How will you manage Team Conflicts?

With the diversity in backgrounds and working styles of team members, the first step is to expect and prepare for 
conflicts during the test project.

The next step is to hold a meeting and appraise team members of the project status. The Test Manager needs to keep 
communication open for everyone such that the team frustrations and anger are vented out. Lastly, ask the team members 
to co-operate and stress the importance of their cooperation for the success of the project.
